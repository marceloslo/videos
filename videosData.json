According to a report in the Financial Times, this is exactly what is being contemplated. One tool to help make this happen, according to these reports, is the use of the emergency use authorization (EUA) in October. Currently, A UK study involving AZD1222 has enrolled 10,000 participants while U.S. government agencies established the bar at 30,000 volunteers. The White House has declined to comment on any fast-tracking of AZD1222. It should be noted that This investigational product, developed by University of Oxford is considered by some to be the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Now, AZD1222 has arrived in America for the Phase 3 pivotal study, which has an estimated start date of August 17, according to government disclosures.  And so, TrialSite identified a major anomaly worthy of discussion.

According to a report in the Financial Times, this is exactly what is being contemplated. One tool to help make this happen, according to these reports, is the use of the emergency use authorization (EUA) in October. Currently, A UK study involving AZD1222 has enrolled 10,000 participants while U.S. government agencies established the bar at 30,000 volunteers. The White House has declined to comment on any fast-tracking of AZD1222. It should be noted that This investigational product, developed by University of Oxford is considered by some to be the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Now, AZD1222 has arrived in America for the Phase 3 pivotal study, which has an estimated start date of August 17, according to government disclosures.  And so, TrialSite identified a major anomaly worthy of discussion. It involves the study\u2019s estimated primary completion date: unlike any other major COVID-19 Phase 3 vaccine study in the West or for that matter in the East.

TrialSite explained the emergency use access concept and suggested she contact her husband\u2019s medical team at the hospital immediately to see if that was available. Additionally, TrialSite sent an email communication to the CEO of NeuroRx Inc., the partner to the actual intellectual property owner, Swiss-based Relief Therapeutics (RELIEF). Why?

I have been hearing all kinds of rumors versus reality on social media, on the telephone among friends, among family members, and people have been really giving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine a bad rep. But in today's video, I'm going to break it down. Rumor vs Reality: Is it something that should be laughed at? Or is it actually a good vaccine with more protection than you realize? I'm going to cover four topics in this video. \n\n\n1. COVID-19 Vaccines Compared\nI'll discuss the difference between the messenger RNA vaccines, like the Pfizer and Moderna, and the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I'll talk about the difference in the science of the vaccine.\n\n2. COVID-19 Vaccination Data\nI'll talk about what percentage of protection you get from the messenger RNA vaccines versus the Johnson and johnson vaccine, and I'll discuss the implications of that data.\n\n3. Is It Fair To Compare?\nIs it fair to compare the mRNA vaccines with Johnson and Johnson vaccine given that the studies took place during different time periods?\nThe Johnson and Johnson vaccine was tested while we had variants. Those same variants weren't around for Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. So is it fair to compare?\n\n4. Would I Take The Johnson and Johnson Vaccine?\nI will answer the question: What would I do?\nIf I were offered the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, what would I do? I'll answer that question and I'll answer it honestly.\n\n\nI'm really curious to see what your thoughts are. So please drop down in the comments if number one, if you had any of the vaccines already, and then tell me what you would do. Would you get that Johnson & Johnson vaccine if it were the only vaccine available to you?

For medical advice, please consult your physician.\n\nPlease comment below and let me know your feelings or your experiences with the vaccines. #thetruthaboutvaccines #drfrita #howvaccineswork\n\nI say \u201cThere is no correlation\u2026\u201d a few times in this video, but what  I SHOULD have said is, \u201cThere is no causation.\u201d There is no CAUSATION between the MMR vaccine and Autism.\n\nSo now I've talked about all of the wonderful aspects of vaccines. They are able to cleverly trick your immune system and to build a defense without you actually having to get sick, and vaccines are responsible for saving millions upon millions upon millions of lives by preventing and even eradicating some devastating infections. So why is there so much controversy? \n\nWell, there are a few things. One major concern, one major question, is do vaccines cause autism? Fortunately, this question has an answer, but let me give you some history.\n\nThere was a study published by \"The Lancet\" back in 1998 and, in that study, there were 12 children who had received the MMR or the measles, mumps, rubella vaccination. \n\nThe physicians who wrote this paper said that nine of these children developed autism and that the parents of eight of these children believed that autism was caused by the MMR vaccination. Now, mind you, there were only 12 patients in this paper because you can't even call it a study. Subsequently, there have been multiple, multiple studies performed, which show no correlation between the measles, mumps, rubella vaccination, and autism. And, as opposed to these 12 children in this one study, in the subsequent studies, there have been hundreds of thousands of patients, and there has been no correlation. In addition, there were 12 authors to that \"Lancet\" study in 1998, which said that MMR caused autism. 10 of the scientists who wrote this paper withdrew their statements. \n\nThey said that they were mistaken, that the study was flawed and that the MMR vaccination does not cause autism. One of the 12 scientists was not able to be contacted before the other 10 withdrew. And then there was one physician, one lone physician, who stands by his word and said that MMR caused autism. Well, there was an investigation that found that this one lone scientist, this one physician who stands by his word that the MMR vaccine pain caused autism, he committed fraud. He actually changed the data. \n\nHe changed the parents' answers. He even changed information, which makes it questionable if all of these children actually had autism. He completely committed fraud, and \"The Lancet\" later declared that the study, this 1998 study, was a fraudulent study. In addition, more studies were done. There have since been over 18 studies on three different continents, and all of them reveal that there is no correlation between MMR vaccine and autism. So there is no data to support that vaccines cause autism. That's the data. That's the science. The other controversy surrounding vaccines, side effects. And yes, vaccines can have side effects as can all medical treatments. So let's talk about that MMR vaccine, again, as far as the side effects. Well, 10% of children who get the MMR vaccine will have a fever, 5% will have a mild rash, 0.001% will have a serious allergic reaction, 0.0001% of boys will get orchitis or inflammation of the testicles. That's scary, but again it's 0.0001%. And then you have 0.0001% of children who will develop encephalitis. So yes, there are some side effects to vaccines but, in most developed countries and with our modern medicine, by far the majority of children who receive vaccines will do well. \n\nAnd, when you look at those numbers that I just gave you for the potential side effects of MMR, and then you compare it to the fact that, prior to the MMR vaccination, seven to eight million children were dying every year, you can balance the risk-to-benefit ratio for yourself. \n\nSo what's the truth about vaccines? They save lives, they prevent infections, they do not cause autism, they do have some side effects. I told you, at the beginning of this video, that I would tell you the number one side effect of vaccines. The number one side effect?

In addition, there were 12 authors to that \"Lancet\" study in 1998, which said that MMR caused autism. 10 of the scientists who wrote this paper withdrew their statements. \n\nThey said that they were mistaken, that the study was flawed and that the MMR vaccination does not cause autism. One of the 12 scientists was not able to be contacted before the other 10 withdrew. And then there was one physician, one lone physician, who stands by his word and said that MMR caused autism. Well, there was an investigation that found that this one lone scientist, this one physician who stands by his word that the MMR vaccine pain caused autism, he committed fraud. He actually changed the data. \n\nHe changed the parents' answers. He even changed information, which makes it questionable if all of these children actually had autism. He completely committed fraud, and \"The Lancet\" later declared that the study, this 1998 study, was a fraudulent study. In addition, more studies were done. There have since been over 18 studies on three different continents, and all of them reveal that there is no correlation between MMR vaccine and autism. So there is no data to support that vaccines cause autism. That's the data. That's the science. The other controversy surrounding vaccines, side effects. And yes, vaccines can have side effects as can all medical treatments. So let's talk about that MMR vaccine, again, as far as the side effects. Well, 10% of children who get the MMR vaccine will have a fever, 5% will have a mild rash, 0.001% will have a serious allergic reaction, 0.0001% of boys will get orchitis or inflammation of the testicles. That's scary, but again it's 0.0001%. And then you have 0.0001% of children who will develop encephalitis. So yes, there are some side effects to vaccines but, in most developed countries and with our modern medicine, by far the majority of children who receive vaccines will do well. \n\nAnd, when you look at those numbers that I just gave you for the potential side effects of MMR, and then you compare it to the fact that, prior to the MMR vaccination, seven to eight million children were dying every year, you can balance the risk-to-benefit ratio for yourself. \n\nSo what's the truth about vaccines? They save lives, they prevent infections, they do not cause autism, they do have some side effects. I told you, at the beginning of this video, that I would tell you the number one side effect of vaccines. The number one side effect?

She is a viral immunologist and she alongside Dr. Barney Graham has been the lead scientist in developing the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  It\u2019s absolutely true. She\u2019s a lead scientist, she leads the team and she has actually been working on this coronavirus vaccine-related data since 2014.\n\nNow you may recall that even though this is the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, it\u2019s not the first coronavirus to ever hit the Earth. In fact, common colds are caused by coronaviruses. Also, the original SARS and MERS have been caused by a coronavirus. If you have not done so already, I want you to please check out my YouTube channel, I actually did a video on coronaviruses in general to give you some type of history.

She says that she's someone who has always loved science and always loved solving math problems. Even at a young age in elementary school, she started winning regional science competitions.

She was the lead scientist who developed the technology to get this platform to a place where it could become an antigen that is recognized by our bodies so that we can create antibodies to the COVID-19.\n\nI've actually discussed the messenger RNA science in some of my other videos.

But I do have some patients who boldly announce that they do not want vaccines, they are not getting vaccines and they do not get vaccines for their children.  Today, I'm going to talk about why is that? Why is there so much controversy over vaccines?\rMuch of the controversy over vaccines is due to the fear of what vaccines might cause. But why isn't there a greater fear of the debilitating and potentially fatal diseases, which vaccines definitely prevent? Well, why aren't people afraid of the boogeymen? Because they've never seen them. Same thing. For a lot of the diseases which vaccines have prevented. And in some cases completely eradicated. Well, many of us, especially in developed countries have never seen these diseases. And so, it's difficult to fear what you don't see, but let's talk about some of the diseases that vaccines do prevent or have eradicated.\n\n#howvaccineswork #thetruthaboutvaccines #drfrita\n\nWhat Diseases Do Vaccines Prevent?\r\n\nSmallpox\r\nSmallpox was a devastating infection, which killed almost 80% of the children infected. And in the 1950s, over 50 million people were infected with smallpox each year. Well thanks to vaccines, smallpox has now been eradicated. You don't see it anymore.\r\n\nMeasles\r\n\nAccording to the Journal of Pathology measles killed 7 to 8 million children each year. And this was prior to the measles vaccine. We don't see deaths like that anymore.\r\n\nPolio\n\n\rPolio is the infection, which paralyzed President FDR. And, in the 1940s and the 1950s, it either paralyzed or killed over 1/2 a million people worldwide each year. This was prior to the polio vaccination. Now, you don't see polio at all, in developed countries. So though there may be controversy about vaccines. The one thing that is not controversial is that vaccines do prevent infections and they do prevent deaths.\r\n\nThe Truth About Vaccines: How Do Vaccines Work?\r  So let's talk. Let's talk about the truth about vaccines. First off, how do vaccines work? Well, they work with your immune system. So your immune system is the system that protects your body against infection. It's like your army of soldiers.\r Every day, there are viruses, bacteria when other potential infections, which try to invade your body, they try to attack you, but your immune system protects you. Your immune system consists of white blood cells and other components, which act like your soldiers. \r\n\nMake sure you hit that notification bell. So you'll know when I release part two. In part two, I will get into the controversy of vaccines. I'll talk about autism as relates to vaccinations, and I'll discuss the side effects of vaccinations. You don't wanna miss it.

Even though syphilis has been around for centuries, do you know it still has not been eradicated? In fact, syphilis is making a comeback. According to the CDC, ever since 2001, the prevalence of syphilis has been increasing each year.\nNow it is a sexually transmitted infection, but it's preventable. It is absolutely preventable. Currently, it is more common among men having sex with men, but don't let that fool you. Women, you are at high risk, and pregnant women, you can transmit syphilis to your unborn children, congenital syphilis.\nSyphilis is caused by a bacterium, treponema pallidum. There are four stages of syphilis. Primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. Syphilis can be passed on through any kind of sexual contact, vaginal, anal, oral, any kind. But again, it can be prevented by using barrier protection, by using condoms. Apparently, Adolf Hitler did not always use condoms because it has been reported that he contracted syphilis from a prostitute.\nNow after being initially infected, after two to three weeks, Hitler would have developed a chancre. A chancre is an ulcer which is surrounded by a raised, hard border. The chancre appears on the genital area or wherever the sexual contact has occurred. This is the first symptom of primary syphilis. Primary syphilis has the symptom of a chancre on the genital area. Now the scary thing about this chancre is that it is absolutely painless, so if you don't notice that you have the chancre, or if you are in such denial that you can't want to seek treatment, you can go on and be untreated for syphilis, and eventually, this chancre will disappear. The chancre disappears, but syphilis does not, that sneaky syphilis. And in a few weeks or even months, you will develop secondary syphilis, very likely, if you're not treated.\nSo what is secondary syphilis? In secondary syphilis, the symptoms tend to be more generalized. Patients will get fever, rash, sore throat. They may get alopecia or hair loss, and this rash is distinct. It tends to be on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Again, with secondary syphilis, if you don't get treated, eventually, the signs are likely to disappear, but you still have syphilis and you are still very contagious if you have not been treated. That sneaky syphilis.\nBack in 1932, 399 African-American men were enrolled in a study. These men were recruited from Macon County, Alabama, which was 95% black, and the men had syphilis, mostly primary or secondary syphilis. Most of these men were poor sharecroppers who had never received medical care, and even though the investigators knew that they had syphilis, they did not tell the men. They did not properly enroll the men for the study. They did not tell them that they had the right to stop the study. And even once a treatment for syphilis was discovered in 1947, they did not offer these black men treatment. In fact, they essentially treated them like lab animals and they sat there and documented all of the symptoms of syphilis without treatment.\nFinally, in 1972, someone blew the whistle on the study.

Even though syphilis has been around for centuries, do you know it still has not been eradicated? In fact, syphilis is making a comeback. According to the CDC, ever since 2001, the prevalence of syphilis has been increasing each year.\nNow it is a sexually transmitted infection, but it's preventable. It is absolutely preventable. Currently, it is more common among men having sex with men, but don't let that fool you. Women, you are at high risk, and pregnant women, you can transmit syphilis to your unborn children, congenital syphilis.\nSyphilis is caused by a bacterium, treponema pallidum. There are four stages of syphilis. Primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. Syphilis can be passed on through any kind of sexual contact, vaginal, anal, oral, any kind. But again, it can be prevented by using barrier protection, by using condoms. Apparently, Adolf Hitler did not always use condoms because it has been reported that he contracted syphilis from a prostitute.\nNow after being initially infected, after two to three weeks, Hitler would have developed a chancre. A chancre is an ulcer which is surrounded by a raised, hard border. The chancre appears on the genital area or wherever the sexual contact has occurred. This is the first symptom of primary syphilis. Primary syphilis has the symptom of a chancre on the genital area. Now the scary thing about this chancre is that it is absolutely painless, so if you don't notice that you have the chancre, or if you are in such denial that you can't want to seek treatment, you can go on and be untreated for syphilis, and eventually, this chancre will disappear.

In its current state, if SB 277 became law it would require parents to have their children fully vaccinated in order to attend public or private school, even though there is no public health crisis and the diseases for which children are vaccinated against are not deadly when children have strong, healthy immune function. Vaccination is an invasive medical procedure that carries substantial risk, yet the manufacturers of vaccines are not liable when their products seriously maim or kill people.

Allergic Reactions and Side Effects", "description": "Moderna Covid Vaccine Update: Is the Moderna Vaccine Safe? Allergic Reactions and Side Effects\n\nAllergic Reactions! \nBell's Palsy! \nSide effects! \nPregnant Women! \nBreastfeeding mothers! \nHow safe is the Moderna Vaccine? \nModerna enrolled over 30,000 volunteers age 18 and older in its double-blind placebo-controlled study.  11,000 were from communities of color, 7,000 were 65 and older, and 5000 were under 65 with conditions that increased their risk for severe COVID 19.  Half received the vaccine, and half received a placebo, so 15,000 in the placebo group, 15,000 who got the vaccine. Symptomatic COVID 19 was confirmed in 185 people in the placebo group and 11 people in the vaccinated group, making the vaccine 94.1 percent effective. Researchers actively monitored the vaccine recipients for local and systemic side effects for seven days after vaccination, recorded unsolicited side-effects for 28 days, and more severe side effects and medically-attended adverse events from day 1 through 759. \n\nSummary of The Safety Profile\nLike Pfizer, those under the age of 65 experienced more frequent mild to moderate side effects than those over age 65. The safety profile was similar across age groups, genders, ethnic and racial groups, participants with or without comorbid conditions, and participants with or without evidence of prior COVID 19 infection. These systemic side-effects are unpleasant and are at a higher rate than seen in most vaccines. In most cases, they are more likely related to the lipid nanoparticles with super tiny amounts of polyethylene glycol.\n\nModerna reported no anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions to the vaccine, but a hypersensitivity reaction was reported in 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% of placebo recipients. The FDA's website has the list of ingredients found in all vaccines and advises that people with a history of severe allergic reactions check the list and discuss the risk of vaccination with their doctor. A Boston doctor had a severe allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. He did have a history of having an allergic reaction to shellfish in the past as well. He was rushed to an emergency room, treated, and released. It was also initially recommended that pregnant women or those who intend to become pregnant in three months should not get the vaccine due to their inclusion in the studies. But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recently released a statement supporting vaccination for both pregnant and breastfeeding mothers.\n\nOther Reactions\nBell's palsy was observed in three people in the vaccinated group and one in the placebo group. Bell's palsy is a condition that causes temporary weakness or paralysis in the muscles on one side of the face. It is frequently a reaction to a viral infection. A recent study in Italy reported that out of 38 people presenting to a local emergency room for symptoms consistent with Bell's Palsy, 21 percent had COVID 19. In 2019, at the same emergency room, 22 people were treated for Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy usually resolves on its own within six months. Bell's palsy incidence as a side effect from the vaccine will be tracked and compared to Bell's palsy incidence in the unvaccinated population. \nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, a neurological disorder that can cause muscle weakness or even paralysis, has not been reported during coronavirus vaccine clinical trials. Ine Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) does not list Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome's history as a general vaccination precaution.\n\nWith the latest guideline, the only people who should not get the vaccine are those who are known to be allergic to any of its ingredients, which is a cutoff that holds true for every single medical product. Ingredients include lipid nanoparticles and polyethylene glycol. Anaphylactic reactions can occur with any vaccine but are usually extremely rare\u2014about one per 1 million doses. As of 19 December, the United States had seen six cases of anaphylaxis among 272,001 people who received the COVID 19 vaccine and 2 recorded cases in the UK. As with everything we do, from driving a car to eating food that may be potentially allergenic, we weigh the risks and benefits that need to be weighed against each other. In this case, the risks and potential consequences of COVID 19 far outweigh the risks from the vaccine.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nIG Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/\nFB Page: https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen\n\n#covid #covid19", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uv3REjrZDio/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uv3REjrZDio/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uv3REjrZDio/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uv3REjrZDio/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uv3REjrZDio/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Doctor Mike Hansen", "tags": ["moderna covid vaccine update", "moderna vaccine", "moderna", "moderna covid vaccine", "moderna vaccine explained", "moderna vaccine update", "covid vaccine update today moderna", "vaccine moderna", "covid vaccine update moderna", "covid 19 vaccine", "covid 19 vaccine reactions", "vaccine covid 19", "covid vaccine update today", "doctor explains", "vaccine covid 19 update today", "covid vaccine reactions", "covid vaccine", "covid vaccine update", "covid 19 vaccine side effect", "vaccine covid 19 update", "vaccine"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Moderna Covid Vaccine Update: Is the Moderna Vaccine Safe?

Shortly after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, he reportedly developed acute immune thrombocytopenia. He died 16 days after getting the covid vaccine. Dr. Gregory Michael's cause of death is a result of a brain hemorrhage. Obviously, this is horrible. It\u2019s tragic, and you feel for his family. \n\nBut it makes you wonder, was his death a result of the covid 19 vaccines? \nAnd if it resulted from the covid 19 vaccine, should that change your perspective on the covid 19 vaccines? \nSo I\u2019m going to tell you my thoughts on this, but first, let's learn a little more about what happened. \nPfizer is actively investigating the case.\n\nOver 10 million people in the United States have received at least one shot of either the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine or Moderna Covid 19 Vaccine, the two authorized in the United States. Me personally, I received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, there have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis, meaning a severe allergic reaction. None of which were reported as fatal. Many people have had other side effects like sore arms, fatigue, headache, or fever, which typically last a day or so.\n\nThe Miami-Dade County medical examiner\u2019s office is investigating Dr. Gregory Michael's death, and as of right now, there is no official autopsy report. But based on the reports, let's see what we can make of his case.\n\nDr. Gregory Michael was healthy. He did not smoke. Did not take any medications. Never had any reaction to any medication nor vaccines. Supposedly three days after he gets the 1st dose of the covid 19 vaccines, he developed tiny reddish spots, or petechiae, caused by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet.\n\nThis prompted him to go to the ER. He gets blood work done, and his platelet levels are low, which is something called thrombocytopenia. Platelets are one of the components of blood clotting. If platelets are too low, it makes people more prone to bleeding. Normal platelet counts range from anywhere from 150 000 to 400 000 or so. People can have spontaneous bleeding, including internal bleeding, but that doesn't typically happen unless the platelet levels are less than ten thousand. His levels were reportedly zero, and because they're so low or absent, he gets admitted to the intensive care unit for two weeks. Doctors tried to get his platelet count higher as he had experts from all over the country involved in his care. Presumably, they tried several different treatments. Typically we give platelet transfusions, which is really a blood product that we're transfusing. But also, we give steroids, specifically glucocorticoids, such as salmeterol or methylprednisolone. If that doesn't work, we try other drugs like Ramaplastum or eltrombopag to stimulate the bone marrow to make more platelets. Sometimes we give immunoglobulins, sometimes we give a drug called rituximab, which is a monoclonal antibody. If all else fails, the last resort is to take out the spleen because sometimes a spleen plays a role in sequestering and destroying platelets. So they were actually planning on doing a splenectomy, meaning removing his spleen. Still, shortly before that, he ends up developing a hemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter of minutes. In other words, he bled into his brain. \n\nA sudden get severe thrombocytopenia to the point of bleeding to death because no matter what the cause is, this kind of thing is incredibly rare. I've never had a similar case like this in the intensive care unit. Now there are some cases like this reported with certain drugs medications can lead to thrombocytopenia. As a result of drug-induced antibodies being made by the immune system, they attack the body's platelets. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia refers to acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and it should be suspected when someone has sudden severe thrombocytopenia.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nIG Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/\nFB Page: https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen\n\n#covid #covidvaccine #vaccine", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UijQ-6jhVuc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UijQ-6jhVuc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UijQ-6jhVuc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UijQ-6jhVuc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UijQ-6jhVuc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Doctor Mike Hansen", "tags": ["doctor dies after getting covid 19 vaccine", "vaccine", "pfizer vaccine covid", "covid vaccine", "covid 19 vaccine", "corona vaccine", "covid 19 vaccine deaths", "covid vaccine death", "vaccine deaths", "covid 19 vaccine side effect", "pfizer vaccine", "florida doctor's death", "dr. gregory michael", "vaccine death", "covid 19 vaccine reactions", "doctor dies for covid vaccine", "vaccine for covid 19", "vaccine side effect covid", "covid 19 vaccine death", "covid 19 vaccine side effect video", "covid deaths", "#covid"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Doctor Dies After Getting COVID 19 Vaccine? | Florida Doctor's Death", "description": "Doctor Dies After Getting COVID 19 Vaccine? | Florida Doctor's Death\n\nAn obstetrician/gynecologist (Dr. Gregory Michael) in Miami, Florida, received the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Dec.18th. Shortly after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, he reportedly developed acute immune thrombocytopenia. He died 16 days after getting the covid vaccine. Dr. Gregory Michael's cause of death is a result of a brain hemorrhage. Obviously, this is horrible. It\u2019s tragic, and you feel for his family. \n\nBut it makes you wonder, was his death a result of the covid 19 vaccines? \nAnd if it resulted from the covid 19 vaccine, should that change your perspective on the covid 19 vaccines? \nSo I\u2019m going to tell you my thoughts on this, but first, let's learn a little more about what happened. \nPfizer is actively investigating the case.\n\nOver 10 million people in the United States have received at least one shot of either the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine or Moderna Covid 19 Vaccine, the two authorized in the United States. Me personally, I received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, there have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis, meaning a severe allergic reaction. None of which were reported as fatal. Many people have had other side effects like sore arms, fatigue, headache, or fever, which typically last a day or so.\n\nThe Miami-Dade County medical examiner\u2019s office is investigating Dr. Gregory Michael's death, and as of right now, there is no official autopsy report. But based on the reports, let's see what we can make of his case.\n\nDr. Gregory Michael was healthy. He did not smoke. Did not take any medications. Never had any reaction to any medication nor vaccines. Supposedly three days after he gets the 1st dose of the covid 19 vaccines, he developed tiny reddish spots, or petechiae, caused by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet.\n\nThis prompted him to go to the ER. He gets blood work done, and his platelet levels are low, which is something called thrombocytopenia. Platelets are one of the components of blood clotting. If platelets are too low, it makes people more prone to bleeding. Normal platelet counts range from anywhere from 150 000 to 400 000 or so. People can have spontaneous bleeding, including internal bleeding, but that doesn't typically happen unless the platelet levels are less than ten thousand. His levels were reportedly zero, and because they're so low or absent, he gets admitted to the intensive care unit for two weeks. Doctors tried to get his platelet count higher as he had experts from all over the country involved in his care. Presumably, they tried several different treatments. Typically we give platelet transfusions, which is really a blood product that we're transfusing. But also, we give steroids, specifically glucocorticoids, such as salmeterol or methylprednisolone. If that doesn't work, we try other drugs like Ramaplastum or eltrombopag to stimulate the bone marrow to make more platelets. Sometimes we give immunoglobulins, sometimes we give a drug called rituximab, which is a monoclonal antibody. If all else fails, the last resort is to take out the spleen because sometimes a spleen plays a role in sequestering and destroying platelets. So they were actually planning on doing a splenectomy, meaning removing his spleen. Still, shortly before that, he ends up developing a hemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter of minutes. In other words, he bled into his brain. \n\nA sudden get severe thrombocytopenia to the point of bleeding to death because no matter what the cause is, this kind of thing is incredibly rare. I've never had a similar case like this in the intensive care unit. Now there are some cases like this reported with certain drugs medications can lead to thrombocytopenia. As a result of drug-induced antibodies being made by the immune system, they attack the body's platelets. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia refers to acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and it should be suspected when someone has sudden severe thrombocytopenia.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nIG Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/\nFB Page: https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen\n\n#covid #covidvaccine #vaccine"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT8M21S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "status": {"uploadStatus": "processed", "privacyStatus": "public", "license": "youtube", "embeddable": true, "publicStatsViewable": true, "madeForKids": false}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "4288701", "likeCount": "65912", "dislikeCount": "8954", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "16127"}}], "pageInfo": {"totalResults": 1, "resultsPerPage": 1}}}

Then other vaccines are on the horizon as well that are not mRNA vaccines. 6 vaccines are getting federal government support in the US, and dozens in being developed worldwide. Several of these are in Phase 3 clinical trials, which is the last step before seeking the FDA's go-ahead. The 2 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna synthetically make messenger RNA, a genetic blueprint that signals to the body's cells to start manufacturing a specific protein in the body. Not just any protein but part of the spike protein of the virus. The body\u2019s immune system then says, \u201cHey, we don\u2019t recognize this spike protein guy; we should kick him out of the club. \u201cSo the immune system reacts accordingly. Except when the immune system reacts accordingly, it\u2019s a whole cascade of events, with white blood cells causing a whole bunch of commotion, sending chemical signals to other parts of the body thru the blood, with cytokines, interferons, interleukins\u2026and antibodies are made, which are proteins that bind to pieces of foreign invaders, so that the body is protected the next to go around. This process sometimes causes symptoms to develop, like some arm pain, maybe a little fever, body aches, headache, sometimes nausea, fatigue. And this is what sometimes happens with the flu shot. People sometimes think they got the flu from the flu shot, but that\u2019s never the case. It was the immunological reaction to the vaccination. But back to these mRNA vaccines for COVID. They come in 2 doses, to be taken a few weeks apart. Why? Because the 1st dose, also known as the prime dose, although it does the job, is less than ideal, meaning the level of protective antibodies that develop, they\u2019re there (show hand), but we want them up here (raise hand) to offer better protection. So with the prime dose, the antibodies take 2 weeks to develop. But then we want the second dose, the booster, to get the immune system reactivated. Once that re-activation occurs, immunogenicity is achieved, typically 7-10 days after the booster is given. And when people experience the immune reactions from the mRNA COVID 19 vaccines, it\u2019s not with the 1st dose; it's after the booster. \n\nThe independent board that analyzes the participants in the study found that severe side effects included fatigue (9.7%), muscle pain (8.9%), joint pain (5.2%), and headache (4.5%). Less than 2% had fevers of 39\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C that lasted a day or two. The numbers were lower for the Pfizer vaccine: Severe side effects included fatigue (3.8%) and headache (2%). Now compared to the flu shot, including the high-dose flu shot, these numbers are slightly higher. But otherwise, the trials showed that these vaccines are safe. And they\u2019re very, very effective. In Moderna\u2019s clinical trial, they gave either the vaccine or a placebo to 30,000 people. Of the 15,000 who received the vaccine, 11 developed Covid. Of the 15,000 who received the placebo, 185 developed Covid 19. That\u2019s 94.1% efficacy. None of the 11 people who received the vaccine became severely ill, but 30 of the 185 who received the placebo became severely ill, and one of them died. The vaccine had similar efficacy rates for elderly people and for people in racial minority groups. In Pfizer's clinical trial, the vaccine proved to be 95% effective, and one study participant who received the vaccine developed a severe case of Covid. Both of them give 95% efficacy against symptomatic disease and almost 100% against severe disease.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nIG Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/\nFB Page: https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen\n\n#covid19 #covidvaccine #vaccine", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CwyxGmGXIYM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CwyxGmGXIYM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CwyxGmGXIYM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CwyxGmGXIYM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CwyxGmGXIYM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Doctor Mike Hansen", "tags": ["covid vaccine", "vaccine", "covid 19 vaccine", "vaccine for covid 19", "covid vaccine update", "covid vaccine explained", "pfizer", "coronavirus vaccine update", "astrazeneca", "covid-19 vaccine", "vaccine covid 19", "covid 19 vaccine update", "side effects of covid vaccine", "moderna vaccine", "covid vaccine pfizer", "covid vaccine usa", "astrazeneca covid vaccine", "moderna covid vaccine", "vaccine covid", "vaccine coronavirus", "vaccine pfizer", "coronavirus vaccine pfizer", "covid", "covid 19", "covid 19 vaccine usa"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Covid 19 Vaccine Explained | Covid 19 Vaccine Latest Update Today", "description": "Covid 19 Vaccine Explained | Covid 19 Vaccine Latest Update Today\n*Correction - It Should be Pfizer (not \"Phizer\")\n\n\u23e9 Timestamps, click to skip ahead!\n00:00 Introduction\n1:43 How is it possible a vaccine that, under normal circumstances, would take years to approve could be ready to roll out so quickly and prove to be safe?\n3:30 What are the covid 19 vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer), and how do they work?\n6:03 Safety and Side Effects of covid 19 vaccine\n6:35 How effective are covid 19 vaccines?\n7:31 How long does the covid 19 vaccine protection last?\nDoes it protect against asymptomatic disease?\nDoes it prevent people from spreading the virus to others?\n8:26 Do I still need a vaccine if I had covid 19? \n8:39 Is the vaccine safe for me with my underlying medical condition?\n8:59 Why do the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) require super cold temperatures?\n13:04 Who can get the vaccine?

She also took Birth Control. She worked as a surgical tech for local plastic surgeons. She gets the Moderna Covid 19 vaccine. Her first covid 19 shot goes without incident. Other than a sore arm. Second dose of covid 19 vaccine Moderna - not so much. She gets her 2nd Covid 19 shot on Feb. 1st, which is a Monday. Later that evening, she has a sore arm, nausea, and fever. That\u2019s not unheard of after someone gets the covid 19 vaccine. Some people get a sore arm, fatigue, body aches, slight fever, and chills. Especially after the second covid 19 shot. Especially for younger people. When this happens, people can take Tylenol or ibuprofen. \n_______________________________________\nThis is her GoFundMe page:\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/kassidi-kurill-medical-and-funeral-expenses\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nNo big deal, right? Unless they take too much.  \nShe did take Tylenol, aka Acetaminophen, but we don\u2019t know how much. She felt a little better the next day. By Wednesday, she was not able to pee despite drinking lots of fluids. She says it's the worst she ever felt. Thursday, 6 am, she tells her parents she needs to go to the hospital. In the ER, she immediately starts throwing up. Doctors say, \u201cshe was very, very sick, and her liver was not functioning.\" Blood tests show that her liver is not working. The doctors give her IV fluids. They also give her a drug to counteract the effects of Tylenol on the liver. It's called NAC, or n-acetylcysteine. But the damage was already done. Around this time, she becomes incoherent. This is because acute liver failure causes the brain to swell, called cerebral edema. If severe enough, it can result in a coma. At this point, her only chance of survival is with a liver transplant. \n\nSo she was flown to a transplant hospital. But when the liver completely fails, it causes other organs to follow suit. Especially the kidneys and brain, and soon after heart and lungs. She\u2019s put on full life support, including a breathing tube. Even if there was a match for a new liver, she is too unstable to undergo that operation. She dies. About 30 hours after she first arrived at the ER. She leaves behind a young daughter who wants people to hear her story. \n\nA lot of people will conclude that the covid 19 vaccine caused her death. \nBut timing by itself does not prove causation. \nAnd a lot of people want to know, did the covid 19 vaccine cause her death? \nAnd if not, then what? \nA Utah medical examiner completed a full autopsy...but the results remain private. The Medical Examiner said the autopsy did not show a link between the covid 19 vaccine and death. \n\nWhich is hardly surprising. If a covid 19 vaccine caused someone to die shortly after receiving it, how would it do so? The only medical explanation would be an immunological reaction. Meaning an allergic reaction. So far in the US, there have been over 200 million covid 19 vaccine doses given. No one has died from a severe allergic reaction as a result of the COVID 19 vaccine. \n\nAnd in her case, it's obvious that she did not have an allergic reaction. For example, there was no swelling in the face or tongue or tightening of the throat. Deaths after COVID 19 vaccinations are reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.\n\nBetween Dec. 14 and mid-March, there have been over 109 million covid 19 vaccine doses in the US. \nOf those, there have been less than 2,000 reports of death on the VAERS system, which is 0.0018%. A reported death in the VAERS system doesn\u2019t mean the covid 19 vaccine caused it.\n\nSo the big question in Kassidi Kurill\u2019s case is\u2026what caused her acute liver failure?\nIn the US, acetaminophen accounts for 40% of cases. \nIn 18% of cases, there is no identifiable cause. 13% are due to idiosyncratic drug reactions. \nThe general recommended dose for acetaminophen in healthy people is no more than 4 grams per day. Sometimes people end up taking more than they should. This accounts for almost half of the cases of acetaminophen-induced-acute liver failure.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nIG Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/\nFB Page: https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen\n\n#covidvaccine #vaccine #covid19vaccine", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wosyaWiDR2U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wosyaWiDR2U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wosyaWiDR2U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wosyaWiDR2U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wosyaWiDR2U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Doctor Mike Hansen", "tags": ["post vaccine deaths", "covid 19 vaccine", "moderna covid 19 vaccine", "covid 19 shot", "second dose of covid 19", "second dose", "dose of covid 19", "covid 19 vaccine reactions", "vaccine side effect", "covid 19 vaccine side effect", "covid vaccine side effect", "covid 19 vaccine shot", "second dose of covid 19 vaccine", "second dose of covid 19 vaccine reaction", "2nd dose of covid 19", "second covid shot effects", "dies after getting moderna vaccine", "covid 19 shots", "covid vaccine", "covid vaccine death"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Woman Dies 4 days after getting COVID 19 Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths", "description": "Woman Dies 4 days after getting COVID 19 Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths\n\nKassidi Kurill, a 39-year-old Single Mom. Her family describes her as healthy, happy, and \u201chaving more energy\u201d than most. She had no known health problems. Unless you count Trigeminal Neuralgia. She took Botox for that. She also took Birth Control. She worked as a surgical tech for local plastic surgeons. She gets the Moderna Covid 19 vaccine. Her first covid 19 shot goes without incident. Other than a sore arm. Second dose of covid 19 vaccine Moderna - not so much. She gets her 2nd Covid 19 shot on Feb. 1st, which is a Monday. Later that evening, she has a sore arm, nausea, and fever. That\u2019s not unheard of after someone gets the covid 19 vaccine. Some people get a sore arm, fatigue, body aches, slight fever, and chills. Especially after the second covid 19 shot. Especially for younger people. When this happens, people can take Tylenol or ibuprofen. \n_______________________________________\nThis is her GoFundMe page:\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/kassidi-kurill-medical-and-funeral-expenses\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nNo big deal, right? Unless they take too much.  \nShe did take Tylenol, aka Acetaminophen, but we don\u2019t know how much. She felt a little better the next day. By Wednesday, she was not able to pee despite drinking lots of fluids. She says it's the worst she ever felt. Thursday, 6 am, she tells her parents she needs to go to the hospital. In the ER, she immediately starts throwing up. Doctors say, \u201cshe was very, very sick, and her liver was not functioning.\" Blood tests show that her liver is not working. The doctors give her IV fluids. They also give her a drug to counteract the effects of Tylenol on the liver. It's called NAC, or n-acetylcysteine. But the damage was already done. Around this time, she becomes incoherent. This is because acute liver failure causes the brain to swell, called cerebral edema. If severe enough, it can result in a coma. At this point, her only chance of survival is with a liver transplant. \n\nSo she was flown to a transplant hospital. But when the liver completely fails, it causes other organs to follow suit. Especially the kidneys and brain, and soon after heart and lungs. She\u2019s put on full life support, including a breathing tube. Even if there was a match for a new liver, she is too unstable to undergo that operation. She dies. About 30 hours after she first arrived at the ER. She leaves behind a young daughter who wants people to hear her story. \n\nA lot of people will conclude that the covid 19 vaccine caused her death. \nBut timing by itself does not prove causation. \nAnd a lot of people want to know, did the covid 19 vaccine cause her death? \nAnd if not, then what? \nA Utah medical examiner completed a full autopsy...but the results remain private. The Medical Examiner said the autopsy did not show a link between the covid 19 vaccine and death. \n\nWhich is hardly surprising. If a covid 19 vaccine caused someone to die shortly after receiving it, how would it do so? The only medical explanation would be an immunological reaction. Meaning an allergic reaction. So far in the US, there have been over 200 million covid 19 vaccine doses given. No one has died from a severe allergic reaction as a result of the COVID 19 vaccine. \n\nAnd in her case, it's obvious that she did not have an allergic reaction. For example, there was no swelling in the face or tongue or tightening of the throat. Deaths after COVID 19 vaccinations are reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.\n\nBetween Dec. 14 and mid-March, there have been over 109 million covid 19 vaccine doses in the US. \nOf those, there have been less than 2,000 reports of death on the VAERS system, which is 0.0018%. A reported death in the VAERS system doesn\u2019t mean the covid 19 vaccine caused it.\n\nSo the big question in Kassidi Kurill\u2019s case is\u2026what caused her acute liver failure?\nIn the US, acetaminophen accounts for 40% of cases. \nIn 18% of cases, there is no identifiable cause. 13% are due to idiosyncratic drug reactions. \nThe general recommended dose for acetaminophen in healthy people is no more than 4 grams per day.

Many studies illustrate both types of vaccine failure as well as the concerning potential for vaccinated individuals to transmit disease to others. In a 2017 measles outbreak in vaccinated individuals in Israel\u2014reported on by the CDC\u2014all but one patient had laboratory evidence of a \u201cprevious immune response\u201d (secondary vaccine failure), and the one patient who did not display such evidence reported nonetheless having received two doses of vaccine (primary vaccine failure). In addition, the index patient\u2014the one who launched the chain of transmission\u2014had received three doses of measles-containing vaccine. In a 2011 measles outbreak in New York City, \u201call cases had prior evidence of measles immunity,\u201d and a twice-vaccinated individual\u2014whose \u201cclinical presentation\u201d was just like natural measles\u2014was shown to have transmitted measles to others. Currently there have been over 9000 cases of mumps but that isn't getting media scrutiny. In MMR-related lawsuits against Merck, former Merck scientists avow that Merck \u201cfraudulently misled the government and omitted, concealed, and adulterated material information regarding the efficacy of its mumps vaccine in violation of the FCA [False Claims Act].\u201d According to a report by Huffpost, the company\u2019s \u201cfar-ranging\u201d fraudulent activities were designed to help Merck monopolize the mumps vaccine market, even though Merck \u201cexpected outbreaks to occur\u201d as a result of its shoddy vaccine. Lastly, The MMR vaccine contains aborted fetal cells. This is strictly against the religion of many. America was founded upon religious independence.

Many studies illustrate both types of vaccine failure as well as the concerning potential for vaccinated individuals to transmit disease to others. In a 2017 measles outbreak in vaccinated individuals in Israel\u2014reported on by the CDC\u2014all but one patient had laboratory evidence of a \u201cprevious immune response\u201d (secondary vaccine failure), and the one patient who did not display such evidence reported nonetheless having received two doses of vaccine (primary vaccine failure). In addition, the index patient\u2014the one who launched the chain of transmission\u2014had received three doses of measles-containing vaccine. In a 2011 measles outbreak in New York City, \u201call cases had prior evidence of measles immunity,\u201d and a twice-vaccinated individual\u2014whose \u201cclinical presentation\u201d was just like natural measles\u2014was shown to have transmitted measles to others. Currently there have been over 9000 cases of mumps but that isn't getting media scrutiny. In MMR-related lawsuits against Merck, former Merck scientists avow that Merck \u201cfraudulently misled the government and omitted, concealed, and adulterated material information regarding the efficacy of its mumps vaccine in violation of the FCA [False Claims Act].\u201d According to a report by Huffpost, the company\u2019s \u201cfar-ranging\u201d fraudulent activities were designed to help Merck monopolize the mumps vaccine market, even though Merck \u201cexpected outbreaks to occur\u201d as a result of its shoddy vaccine. Lastly, The MMR vaccine contains aborted fetal cells. This is strictly against the religion of many. America was founded upon religious independence. The state should not Force vaccinate anyone against their will and religion.

In this episode, we discuss the COVID-19 vaccines, and what questions you would want to answer in order to understand them: Are they safe? Are they effective? If you survive COVID-19, what are the long-term health effects? We discuss what an mRNA vaccine is and does, and how the immune system functions (and fails to function). We also talk about what makes flies sexy.

If you survive COVID-19, what are the long-term health effects? We discuss what an mRNA vaccine is and does, and how the immune system functions (and fails to function). We also talk about what makes flies sexy.

The Lord said me to tell the church as He taught me saying - There are many preparations, initiations, and harvests of the kingdom of heaven and of darkness going on the earth. There are so much preparation done by the kingdom of darkness, and there's no one to stop them because there are scarcity of faithful Reapers. The Lord said - I gave this quotation (Lk 14:16-24) because it's popularly used and many have taught through them but they lack understanding in the spirit of wisdom and revelation. They fail to realize that it's the spirit of prophecy till the fulfilment of Christ's coming be fulfilled. The Lord said - the kingdoms of darkness live and monitor the times and seasons of times, but the children of light fail to realize that this word of the Lord is the Spirit of Prophecy.\n\nThen, the Lord said - in this scripture there are three categories of people that were, are and will be from the foundation of the world until the coming of Christ Jesus. For in these categories He has extended His salvation. He said - the first category are those that gave excuses of ground, of oxen, and wife. They truly serve the Lord and fear Him; they're those that walk in His ways and can't even stand those that err around them. They're have become the role models to others, for many look up to them. They've grown so much in the Lord for years, but these are their offenses; they are careless to what is around them. What they couldn't afford to commit against God before is what they craftily commit without remorse. And because they still have the grace of God in them, they believe it'll save them. They can't be taught anymore, neither receive the words of God from others. The Lord said - the reason why I said they'll never taste from my supper is because - they shall be bound in their carelessness and will not be able to discover their shame, and they shall not seek correction but continue until it shall be too late for them.\n\nThen, the Lord said - the second category are those from the streets, the poor, the maimed, the halt and the blind. He said - they are called The Blind Faithfuls. They are those that like double lives. They live for God with a true heart but live for the devil. They fear the Lord knowing His power and glory but never His salvation. They are good givers and never joke with the things of God, However, when they're not in the presence of God, everything that's of the world, they embrace it. Everything and anything of luxury and wealth, they yearn for it. But they are not pretenders. People know them for who they are and what they are. The Lord has extended His hand of salvation, but their time has passed.\n\nAccording to the Spirit of Prophecy of the quotation given to the church by the Lord, we are now in the last and final category. These are the ones from the highways and hedges. The Lord said - I have sent my angels to rescue them and deliver them, for they are those that are lost and hopeless. They are those that don't have any chance or strength to lift up their heads to heaven and say Abba Father. Now, the Lord said - I go a fishing for souls, will you go with me? This is the mystery of the Reapers. The Lord is searching for the Reapers of Grace and Truth. He said to me - The reapers must be worthy and better in holiness and righteousness than all the three categories. They are the ones I gave the ministry to reap where they didn't sow; this ministry wasn't given to the angels. The reapers must be perfect; if they're not, the freed captives will return back to bondage. They are The reapers to Evangelise, the reapers of Intercession, and the reapers In the Shepherds' Office. I seek reapers to reap the harvests of my angels I've sent forth to deliver the captives They aremy last harvest, and then the end shall come.\n\nYouTube - RAPEC Tv\nWebsite - www.raptureproclaimer.org\n\nGod bless you", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdUyJF0X_kc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdUyJF0X_kc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdUyJF0X_kc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdUyJF0X_kc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdUyJF0X_kc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "The Messiahs Return", "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "URGENT RAPTURE MESSAGE - RESTITUTION - THE RETURN OF JESUS CHRIST", "description": "*RAPTURE PROCLAIMER EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF GOD*\nTopic: *WHO SHALL REAP MY HARVEST?*\n*Text: Lk. 14:16-24.*\n*Date: 26th April 2020*\n\nThe message of the Lord came to me at about 3am 25th April 2020 to the church saying WHO SHALL REAP MY HARVEST?

Specifically, does a positive PCR-test result mean that the person tested is infected with Covid-19, or does it mean absolutely nothing in connection with the Covid-19 infection?\n\n2) Do the so-called anti-corona measures, such as the lockdown, mandatory face masks, social distancing, and quarantine regulations, serve to protect the world\u2019s population from corona? Or do these measures serve only to make people panic so that they believe, without asking any questions, that their lives are in danger \u2014 so that, in the end, the pharmaceutical and tech industries can generate huge profits from the sale of PCR tests, antigen and antibody tests and vaccines, as well as the harvesting of our genetic fingerprints?\n\n3) Is it true that the German government was massively lobbied, more so than any other country, by the chief protagonists of this so-called corona pandemic (Mr. Drosten, virologist at Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin; Mr. Wieler, veterinarian and head of the German equivalent of the CDC, the RKI; and Mr. Tedros, head of the World Health Organization or WHO) because Germany is known as a particularly disciplined country and was therefore to become a role model for the rest of the world for its strict and, of course, successful adherence to the corona measures?\n\nAll evidence will be available to lawyers around the world to pursue their own class action lawsuits. \n\nDr. Fuellmich also explains that the \u201coverwhelming majority of the alleged Covid-19 victims had died of completely different diseases, but not of Covid-19. The assertion that the lockdown was necessary because there were so many different infections with SARS-CoV-2, and because the healthcare systems would be overwhelmed is wrong for three reasons, as we have learned from the hearings we conducted with the Corona Committee, and from other data that has become available in the meantime:\n\n1) The lockdown was imposed when the virus was already retreating. By the time the lockdown was imposed, the alleged infection rates were already dropping again.\n\n2) There\u2019s already protection from the virus because of cross- or T-cell immunity. Apart from the above mentioned lockdown being imposed when the infection rates were already dropping, there is also cross- or T-cell immunity in the general population against the corona viruses contained in every flu or influenza wave.\n\n3) And this is the most important part of our fact-finding.

Specifically, does a positive PCR-test result mean that the person tested is infected with Covid-19, or does it mean absolutely nothing in connection with the Covid-19 infection?\n\n2) Do the so-called anti-corona measures, such as the lockdown, mandatory face masks, social distancing, and quarantine regulations, serve to protect the world\u2019s population from corona? Or do these measures serve only to make people panic so that they believe, without asking any questions, that their lives are in danger \u2014 so that, in the end, the pharmaceutical and tech industries can generate huge profits from the sale of PCR tests, antigen and antibody tests and vaccines, as well as the harvesting of our genetic fingerprints?\n\n3) Is it true that the German government was massively lobbied, more so than any other country, by the chief protagonists of this so-called corona pandemic (Mr. Drosten, virologist at Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin; Mr. Wieler, veterinarian and head of the German equivalent of the CDC, the RKI; and Mr. Tedros, head of the World Health Organization or WHO) because Germany is known as a particularly disciplined country and was therefore to become a role model for the rest of the world for its strict and, of course, successful adherence to the corona measures?\n\nAll evidence will be available to lawyers around the world to pursue their own class action lawsuits. \n\nDr. Fuellmich also explains that the \u201coverwhelming majority of the alleged Covid-19 victims had died of completely different diseases, but not of Covid-19. The assertion that the lockdown was necessary because there were so many different infections with SARS-CoV-2, and because the healthcare systems would be overwhelmed is wrong for three reasons, as we have learned from the hearings we conducted with the Corona Committee, and from other data that has become available in the meantime:\n\n1) The lockdown was imposed when the virus was already retreating. By the time the lockdown was imposed, the alleged infection rates were already dropping again.\n\n2) There\u2019s already protection from the virus because of cross- or T-cell immunity. Apart from the above mentioned lockdown being imposed when the infection rates were already dropping, there is also cross- or T-cell immunity in the general population against the corona viruses contained in every flu or influenza wave.\n\n3) And this is the most important part of our fact-finding. The PCR test is being used on the basis of false statements, not based on scientific facts with respect to infections. In the meantime, we have learned that these PCR tests, contrary to the assertions of Messrs. Drosten, Wieler and the WHO, do not give any indication of an infection with any virus let alone an infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nVIDEO: https://youtu.be/kr04gHbP5MQ \n\nTRANSCRIPT: https://truthcomestolight.com/2020/10/08/transcript-of-dr-reiner-fuellmichs-crimes-against-humanity-announcing-the-largest-international-class-action-tort-case-in-world-history/ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlease like and subscribe to our Bright Light News youtube channel for more info that sheds a light on the science and data of Covid-19.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @_BLNews_\n\nLike/follow us on Facebook at Bright Light News."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-CA"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT49M1S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "status": {"uploadStatus": "processed", "privacyStatus": "public", "license": "youtube", "embeddable": true, "publicStatsViewable": true, "madeForKids": false}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1348", "likeCount": "69", "dislikeCount": "2", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "7"}}], "pageInfo": {"totalResults": 1, "resultsPerPage": 1}}}

LeBoutillier said that after the war, a deal was cut to pay billions to North Vietnam for rebuilding their country and returning the remaining POWs. But as the Watergate scandal broke, Nixon and Kissinger reneged on the arrangement, and around 700 prisoners were kept in Vietnam. Others have worked for 20 years in Washington DC to uncover the truth about the POWs, and there has been much intelligence that has referenced the missing soldiers. Specifically, spy satellite photographs, one of which (see below) showed \"USA\" spelled out in 12 ft. tall letters in a rice field, along with a 24 ft. tall \"Walking K\" an \"escape and evasion\" code only known to US pilots in N. Laos. In the early 80's, Reagan tried to get the POWs back, but advisors talked him out of it. By 1992, an investigation chaired by McCain and Kerry concluded there were no American refugees left in Vietnam. It is believed there could be as many as 500-600 POWs still alive there, and that the US government is engaged in a cover-up of the evidence for their existence. \nA terrible truth is now emerging: Recently declassified documents show that American prisoners are to this day still crying out for help in Vietnam. \n\nNorth Carolina congressman Bill Hendon and attorney Elizabeth A. Stewart- An Enormous Crime: The Definitive Account of American POW's Abandoned in Southeast Asia - presents evidence that 700 surviving U.S. airmen and infantry were marooned by the country for which they went to war, and to this day remain unacknowledged by that same country, the United States of America. In spite of decades during which these POWs have bravely signaled for help, and in which numerous refugees and visitors from Indochina have in turn corroborated their pleas, their heartrending tale has been dismissed as nothing more than conspiracy theory and rumor. Shockingly, the proof laid out in An Enormous Crime proves otherwise, such as the 1991 satellite images of two Americans in North Vietnam who had stamped out their pilot authenticator codes in the grass in the compound where they were being held. Another satellite photograph showed \"USA\" spelled out in 12-foot-tall letters in a rice field, along with a 24-foot-tall \"Walking K\" - an escape and evasion code only known to U.S. pilots in North Laos.\n\nTo begin to understand this travesty, it's important to go back to the beginning: In 1972, negotiations began with the Vietnamese to settle scores. At issue was the return of American POWs. During late 1972 and early 1973, a deal was struck whereby half of the 1,400 US POWs held by North Vietnam would be released once military withdrawal began. The initial 700 or so American soldiers held captive were flown out of Hanoi during Operation Homecoming later in 1973. It was agreed upon by the Nixon administration and the North Vietnamese that the other 700 POWs would be released upon delivery of $4 billion in war reparations from the United States to the North Vietnamese government. \n\nBut as the Watergate scandal broke, Nixon reneged on the arrangement, and the last 700 POWs were kept in Vietnam. All future presidents after Nixon had their own reasons for failing to take notice off the 700 POWs left behind: For Carter it was the American public's desire to put Vietnam behind them, and later, the Iranian hostage crisis. In the early 80's, Reagan tried to get the POWs back, but his advisors talked him out of it. The problem, the advisors told him, was that the fragile U.S.-backed El Salvadoran government was under serious threat of being overthrown by Russian and Cuban trained Communists, and Nicaragua didn't look far behind. The advisors told Regan that it was necessary to overlook the POWs in order to put all American military efforts toward the darkening South American situation.\n\nAs the 80's gave way to the 90's, re-engagement of Vietnam by the U.S. government became a priority. Thus George H.W. Bush helped maintain the cover up of mounting evidence that hundreds of POWs still survived in Indochina, as did Bill Clinton, who himself struck down all sanctions and embargoes against Vietnam in 1992. But even in that same year, satellite photos over Vietnam revealed airman-specific 4-digit authenticator codes proving almost conclusively that as of 1992, U.S. airmen downed in Vietnam during the war remained alive and were signaling for help.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3UJEmu3V5k/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3UJEmu3V5k/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3UJEmu3V5k/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3UJEmu3V5k/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Veritas TV", "tags": ["mel fabregas", "veritasradio.com", "veritas radio", "veritas show", "veritasshow.com", "george hw bush", "brent scowcroft", "henry kissinger", "vietnam pows", "an enourmous crime", "john leboutillier", "bill hendon", "elizabeth stewart", "john mccain"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "John LeBoutillier U.S. Cover-Up of POW/MIA Abandoned in Southeast Asia (John McCain)", "description": "This is Segment 1 of 2.

I have been hearing all kinds of rumors versus reality on social media, on the telephone among friends, among family members, and people have been really giving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine a bad rep. But in today's video, I'm going to break it down. Rumor vs Reality: Is it something that should be laughed at? Or is it actually a good vaccine with more protection than you realize? I'm going to cover four topics in this video. \n\n\n1. COVID-19 Vaccines Compared\nI'll discuss the difference between the messenger RNA vaccines, like the Pfizer and Moderna, and the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I'll talk about the difference in the science of the vaccine.\n\n2. COVID-19 Vaccination Data\nI'll talk about what percentage of protection you get from the messenger RNA vaccines versus the Johnson and johnson vaccine, and I'll discuss the implications of that data.\n\n3. Is It Fair To Compare?\nIs it fair to compare the mRNA vaccines with Johnson and Johnson vaccine given that the studies took place during different time periods?\nThe Johnson and Johnson vaccine was tested while we had variants. Those same variants weren't around for Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. So is it fair to compare?\n\n4. Would I Take The Johnson and Johnson Vaccine?\nI will answer the question: What would I do?\nIf I were offered the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, what would I do? I'll answer that question and I'll answer it honestly.\n\n\nI'm really curious to see what your thoughts are. So please drop down in the comments if number one, if you had any of the vaccines already, and then tell me what you would do. Would you get that Johnson & Johnson vaccine if it were the only vaccine available to you?

For medical advice, please consult your physician.\n\nPlease comment below and let me know your feelings or your experiences with the vaccines. #thetruthaboutvaccines #drfrita #howvaccineswork\n\nI say \u201cThere is no correlation\u2026\u201d a few times in this video, but what  I SHOULD have said is, \u201cThere is no causation.\u201d There is no CAUSATION between the MMR vaccine and Autism.\n\nSo now I've talked about all of the wonderful aspects of vaccines. They are able to cleverly trick your immune system and to build a defense without you actually having to get sick, and vaccines are responsible for saving millions upon millions upon millions of lives by preventing and even eradicating some devastating infections. So why is there so much controversy? \n\nWell, there are a few things. One major concern, one major question, is do vaccines cause autism? Fortunately, this question has an answer, but let me give you some history.\n\nThere was a study published by \"The Lancet\" back in 1998 and, in that study, there were 12 children who had received the MMR or the measles, mumps, rubella vaccination. \n\nThe physicians who wrote this paper said that nine of these children developed autism and that the parents of eight of these children believed that autism was caused by the MMR vaccination. Now, mind you, there were only 12 patients in this paper because you can't even call it a study. Subsequently, there have been multiple, multiple studies performed, which show no correlation between the measles, mumps, rubella vaccination, and autism. And, as opposed to these 12 children in this one study, in the subsequent studies, there have been hundreds of thousands of patients, and there has been no correlation. In addition, there were 12 authors to that \"Lancet\" study in 1998, which said that MMR caused autism. 10 of the scientists who wrote this paper withdrew their statements. \n\nThey said that they were mistaken, that the study was flawed and that the MMR vaccination does not cause autism. One of the 12 scientists was not able to be contacted before the other 10 withdrew. And then there was one physician, one lone physician, who stands by his word and said that MMR caused autism. Well, there was an investigation that found that this one lone scientist, this one physician who stands by his word that the MMR vaccine pain caused autism, he committed fraud. He actually changed the data. \n\nHe changed the parents' answers. He even changed information, which makes it questionable if all of these children actually had autism. He completely committed fraud, and \"The Lancet\" later declared that the study, this 1998 study, was a fraudulent study. In addition, more studies were done. There have since been over 18 studies on three different continents, and all of them reveal that there is no correlation between MMR vaccine and autism. So there is no data to support that vaccines cause autism. That's the data. That's the science. The other controversy surrounding vaccines, side effects. And yes, vaccines can have side effects as can all medical treatments. So let's talk about that MMR vaccine, again, as far as the side effects. Well, 10% of children who get the MMR vaccine will have a fever, 5% will have a mild rash, 0.001% will have a serious allergic reaction, 0.0001% of boys will get orchitis or inflammation of the testicles. That's scary, but again it's 0.0001%. And then you have 0.0001% of children who will develop encephalitis. So yes, there are some side effects to vaccines but, in most developed countries and with our modern medicine, by far the majority of children who receive vaccines will do well. \n\nAnd, when you look at those numbers that I just gave you for the potential side effects of MMR, and then you compare it to the fact that, prior to the MMR vaccination, seven to eight million children were dying every year, you can balance the risk-to-benefit ratio for yourself. \n\nSo what's the truth about vaccines? They save lives, they prevent infections, they do not cause autism, they do have some side effects. I told you, at the beginning of this video, that I would tell you the number one side effect of vaccines. The number one side effect?

In addition, there were 12 authors to that \"Lancet\" study in 1998, which said that MMR caused autism. 10 of the scientists who wrote this paper withdrew their statements. \n\nThey said that they were mistaken, that the study was flawed and that the MMR vaccination does not cause autism. One of the 12 scientists was not able to be contacted before the other 10 withdrew. And then there was one physician, one lone physician, who stands by his word and said that MMR caused autism. Well, there was an investigation that found that this one lone scientist, this one physician who stands by his word that the MMR vaccine pain caused autism, he committed fraud. He actually changed the data. \n\nHe changed the parents' answers. He even changed information, which makes it questionable if all of these children actually had autism. He completely committed fraud, and \"The Lancet\" later declared that the study, this 1998 study, was a fraudulent study. In addition, more studies were done. There have since been over 18 studies on three different continents, and all of them reveal that there is no correlation between MMR vaccine and autism. So there is no data to support that vaccines cause autism. That's the data. That's the science. The other controversy surrounding vaccines, side effects. And yes, vaccines can have side effects as can all medical treatments. So let's talk about that MMR vaccine, again, as far as the side effects. Well, 10% of children who get the MMR vaccine will have a fever, 5% will have a mild rash, 0.001% will have a serious allergic reaction, 0.0001% of boys will get orchitis or inflammation of the testicles. That's scary, but again it's 0.0001%. And then you have 0.0001% of children who will develop encephalitis. So yes, there are some side effects to vaccines but, in most developed countries and with our modern medicine, by far the majority of children who receive vaccines will do well. \n\nAnd, when you look at those numbers that I just gave you for the potential side effects of MMR, and then you compare it to the fact that, prior to the MMR vaccination, seven to eight million children were dying every year, you can balance the risk-to-benefit ratio for yourself. \n\nSo what's the truth about vaccines? They save lives, they prevent infections, they do not cause autism, they do have some side effects. I told you, at the beginning of this video, that I would tell you the number one side effect of vaccines. The number one side effect?

She is a viral immunologist and she alongside Dr. Barney Graham has been the lead scientist in developing the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  It\u2019s absolutely true. She\u2019s a lead scientist, she leads the team and she has actually been working on this coronavirus vaccine-related data since 2014.\n\nNow you may recall that even though this is the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, it\u2019s not the first coronavirus to ever hit the Earth. In fact, common colds are caused by coronaviruses. Also, the original SARS and MERS have been caused by a coronavirus. If you have not done so already, I want you to please check out my YouTube channel, I actually did a video on coronaviruses in general to give you some type of history.

She says that she's someone who has always loved science and always loved solving math problems. Even at a young age in elementary school, she started winning regional science competitions.

She was the lead scientist who developed the technology to get this platform to a place where it could become an antigen that is recognized by our bodies so that we can create antibodies to the COVID-19.\n\nI've actually discussed the messenger RNA science in some of my other videos.

But I do have some patients who boldly announce that they do not want vaccines, they are not getting vaccines and they do not get vaccines for their children.  Today, I'm going to talk about why is that? Why is there so much controversy over vaccines?\rMuch of the controversy over vaccines is due to the fear of what vaccines might cause. But why isn't there a greater fear of the debilitating and potentially fatal diseases, which vaccines definitely prevent? Well, why aren't people afraid of the boogeymen? Because they've never seen them. Same thing. For a lot of the diseases which vaccines have prevented. And in some cases completely eradicated. Well, many of us, especially in developed countries have never seen these diseases. And so, it's difficult to fear what you don't see, but let's talk about some of the diseases that vaccines do prevent or have eradicated.\n\n#howvaccineswork #thetruthaboutvaccines #drfrita\n\nWhat Diseases Do Vaccines Prevent?\r\n\nSmallpox\r\nSmallpox was a devastating infection, which killed almost 80% of the children infected. And in the 1950s, over 50 million people were infected with smallpox each year. Well thanks to vaccines, smallpox has now been eradicated. You don't see it anymore.\r\n\nMeasles\r\n\nAccording to the Journal of Pathology measles killed 7 to 8 million children each year. And this was prior to the measles vaccine. We don't see deaths like that anymore.\r\n\nPolio\n\n\rPolio is the infection, which paralyzed President FDR. And, in the 1940s and the 1950s, it either paralyzed or killed over 1/2 a million people worldwide each year. This was prior to the polio vaccination. Now, you don't see polio at all, in developed countries. So though there may be controversy about vaccines. The one thing that is not controversial is that vaccines do prevent infections and they do prevent deaths.\r\n\nThe Truth About Vaccines: How Do Vaccines Work?\r  So let's talk. Let's talk about the truth about vaccines. First off, how do vaccines work? Well, they work with your immune system. So your immune system is the system that protects your body against infection. It's like your army of soldiers.\r Every day, there are viruses, bacteria when other potential infections, which try to invade your body, they try to attack you, but your immune system protects you. Your immune system consists of white blood cells and other components, which act like your soldiers. \r\n\nMake sure you hit that notification bell. So you'll know when I release part two. In part two, I will get into the controversy of vaccines. I'll talk about autism as relates to vaccinations, and I'll discuss the side effects of vaccinations. You don't wanna miss it.

Even though syphilis has been around for centuries, do you know it still has not been eradicated? In fact, syphilis is making a comeback. According to the CDC, ever since 2001, the prevalence of syphilis has been increasing each year.\nNow it is a sexually transmitted infection, but it's preventable. It is absolutely preventable. Currently, it is more common among men having sex with men, but don't let that fool you. Women, you are at high risk, and pregnant women, you can transmit syphilis to your unborn children, congenital syphilis.\nSyphilis is caused by a bacterium, treponema pallidum. There are four stages of syphilis. Primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. Syphilis can be passed on through any kind of sexual contact, vaginal, anal, oral, any kind. But again, it can be prevented by using barrier protection, by using condoms. Apparently, Adolf Hitler did not always use condoms because it has been reported that he contracted syphilis from a prostitute.\nNow after being initially infected, after two to three weeks, Hitler would have developed a chancre. A chancre is an ulcer which is surrounded by a raised, hard border. The chancre appears on the genital area or wherever the sexual contact has occurred. This is the first symptom of primary syphilis. Primary syphilis has the symptom of a chancre on the genital area. Now the scary thing about this chancre is that it is absolutely painless, so if you don't notice that you have the chancre, or if you are in such denial that you can't want to seek treatment, you can go on and be untreated for syphilis, and eventually, this chancre will disappear. The chancre disappears, but syphilis does not, that sneaky syphilis. And in a few weeks or even months, you will develop secondary syphilis, very likely, if you're not treated.\nSo what is secondary syphilis? In secondary syphilis, the symptoms tend to be more generalized. Patients will get fever, rash, sore throat. They may get alopecia or hair loss, and this rash is distinct. It tends to be on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Again, with secondary syphilis, if you don't get treated, eventually, the signs are likely to disappear, but you still have syphilis and you are still very contagious if you have not been treated. That sneaky syphilis.\nBack in 1932, 399 African-American men were enrolled in a study. These men were recruited from Macon County, Alabama, which was 95% black, and the men had syphilis, mostly primary or secondary syphilis. Most of these men were poor sharecroppers who had never received medical care, and even though the investigators knew that they had syphilis, they did not tell the men. They did not properly enroll the men for the study. They did not tell them that they had the right to stop the study. And even once a treatment for syphilis was discovered in 1947, they did not offer these black men treatment. In fact, they essentially treated them like lab animals and they sat there and documented all of the symptoms of syphilis without treatment.\nFinally, in 1972, someone blew the whistle on the study.

Even though syphilis has been around for centuries, do you know it still has not been eradicated? In fact, syphilis is making a comeback. According to the CDC, ever since 2001, the prevalence of syphilis has been increasing each year.\nNow it is a sexually transmitted infection, but it's preventable. It is absolutely preventable. Currently, it is more common among men having sex with men, but don't let that fool you. Women, you are at high risk, and pregnant women, you can transmit syphilis to your unborn children, congenital syphilis.\nSyphilis is caused by a bacterium, treponema pallidum. There are four stages of syphilis. Primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. Syphilis can be passed on through any kind of sexual contact, vaginal, anal, oral, any kind. But again, it can be prevented by using barrier protection, by using condoms. Apparently, Adolf Hitler did not always use condoms because it has been reported that he contracted syphilis from a prostitute.\nNow after being initially infected, after two to three weeks, Hitler would have developed a chancre. A chancre is an ulcer which is surrounded by a raised, hard border. The chancre appears on the genital area or wherever the sexual contact has occurred. This is the first symptom of primary syphilis. Primary syphilis has the symptom of a chancre on the genital area. Now the scary thing about this chancre is that it is absolutely painless, so if you don't notice that you have the chancre, or if you are in such denial that you can't want to seek treatment, you can go on and be untreated for syphilis, and eventually, this chancre will disappear.

In its current state, if SB 277 became law it would require parents to have their children fully vaccinated in order to attend public or private school, even though there is no public health crisis and the diseases for which children are vaccinated against are not deadly when children have strong, healthy immune function. Vaccination is an invasive medical procedure that carries substantial risk, yet the manufacturers of vaccines are not liable when their products seriously maim or kill people.

Allergic Reactions and Side Effects", "description": "Moderna Covid Vaccine Update: Is the Moderna Vaccine Safe? Allergic Reactions and Side Effects\n\nAllergic Reactions! \nBell's Palsy! \nSide effects! \nPregnant Women! \nBreastfeeding mothers! \nHow safe is the Moderna Vaccine? \nModerna enrolled over 30,000 volunteers age 18 and older in its double-blind placebo-controlled study.  11,000 were from communities of color, 7,000 were 65 and older, and 5000 were under 65 with conditions that increased their risk for severe COVID 19.  Half received the vaccine, and half received a placebo, so 15,000 in the placebo group, 15,000 who got the vaccine. Symptomatic COVID 19 was confirmed in 185 people in the placebo group and 11 people in the vaccinated group, making the vaccine 94.1 percent effective. Researchers actively monitored the vaccine recipients for local and systemic side effects for seven days after vaccination, recorded unsolicited side-effects for 28 days, and more severe side effects and medically-attended adverse events from day 1 through 759. \n\nSummary of The Safety Profile\nLike Pfizer, those under the age of 65 experienced more frequent mild to moderate side effects than those over age 65. The safety profile was similar across age groups, genders, ethnic and racial groups, participants with or without comorbid conditions, and participants with or without evidence of prior COVID 19 infection. These systemic side-effects are unpleasant and are at a higher rate than seen in most vaccines. In most cases, they are more likely related to the lipid nanoparticles with super tiny amounts of polyethylene glycol.\n\nModerna reported no anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions to the vaccine, but a hypersensitivity reaction was reported in 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% of placebo recipients. The FDA's website has the list of ingredients found in all vaccines and advises that people with a history of severe allergic reactions check the list and discuss the risk of vaccination with their doctor. A Boston doctor had a severe allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. He did have a history of having an allergic reaction to shellfish in the past as well. He was rushed to an emergency room, treated, and released. It was also initially recommended that pregnant women or those who intend to become pregnant in three months should not get the vaccine due to their inclusion in the studies. But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recently released a statement supporting vaccination for both pregnant and breastfeeding mothers.\n\nOther Reactions\nBell's palsy was observed in three people in the vaccinated group and one in the placebo group. Bell's palsy is a condition that causes temporary weakness or paralysis in the muscles on one side of the face. It is frequently a reaction to a viral infection. A recent study in Italy reported that out of 38 people presenting to a local emergency room for symptoms consistent with Bell's Palsy, 21 percent had COVID 19. In 2019, at the same emergency room, 22 people were treated for Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy usually resolves on its own within six months. Bell's palsy incidence as a side effect from the vaccine will be tracked and compared to Bell's palsy incidence in the unvaccinated population. \nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, a neurological disorder that can cause muscle weakness or even paralysis, has not been reported during coronavirus vaccine clinical trials. Ine Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) does not list Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome's history as a general vaccination precaution.\n\nWith the latest guideline, the only people who should not get the vaccine are those who are known to be allergic to any of its ingredients, which is a cutoff that holds true for every single medical product. Ingredients include lipid nanoparticles and polyethylene glycol. Anaphylactic reactions can occur with any vaccine but are usually extremely rare\u2014about one per 1 million doses. As of 19 December, the United States had seen six cases of anaphylaxis among 272,001 people who received the COVID 19 vaccine and 2 recorded cases in the UK. As with everything we do, from driving a car to eating food that may be potentially allergenic, we weigh the risks and benefits that need to be weighed against each other. In this case, the risks and potential consequences of COVID 19 far outweigh the risks from the vaccine.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nIG Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/\nFB Page: https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen\n\n#covid #covid19", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uv3REjrZDio/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uv3REjrZDio/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uv3REjrZDio/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uv3REjrZDio/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uv3REjrZDio/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Doctor Mike Hansen", "tags": ["moderna covid vaccine update", "moderna vaccine", "moderna", "moderna covid vaccine", "moderna vaccine explained", "moderna vaccine update", "covid vaccine update today moderna", "vaccine moderna", "covid vaccine update moderna", "covid 19 vaccine", "covid 19 vaccine reactions", "vaccine covid 19", "covid vaccine update today", "doctor explains", "vaccine covid 19 update today", "covid vaccine reactions", "covid vaccine", "covid vaccine update", "covid 19 vaccine side effect", "vaccine covid 19 update", "vaccine"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Moderna Covid Vaccine Update: Is the Moderna Vaccine Safe?

Shortly after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, he reportedly developed acute immune thrombocytopenia. He died 16 days after getting the covid vaccine. Dr. Gregory Michael's cause of death is a result of a brain hemorrhage. Obviously, this is horrible. It\u2019s tragic, and you feel for his family. \n\nBut it makes you wonder, was his death a result of the covid 19 vaccines? \nAnd if it resulted from the covid 19 vaccine, should that change your perspective on the covid 19 vaccines? \nSo I\u2019m going to tell you my thoughts on this, but first, let's learn a little more about what happened. \nPfizer is actively investigating the case.\n\nOver 10 million people in the United States have received at least one shot of either the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine or Moderna Covid 19 Vaccine, the two authorized in the United States. Me personally, I received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, there have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis, meaning a severe allergic reaction. None of which were reported as fatal. Many people have had other side effects like sore arms, fatigue, headache, or fever, which typically last a day or so.\n\nThe Miami-Dade County medical examiner\u2019s office is investigating Dr. Gregory Michael's death, and as of right now, there is no official autopsy report. But based on the reports, let's see what we can make of his case.\n\nDr. Gregory Michael was healthy. He did not smoke. Did not take any medications. Never had any reaction to any medication nor vaccines. Supposedly three days after he gets the 1st dose of the covid 19 vaccines, he developed tiny reddish spots, or petechiae, caused by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet.\n\nThis prompted him to go to the ER. He gets blood work done, and his platelet levels are low, which is something called thrombocytopenia. Platelets are one of the components of blood clotting. If platelets are too low, it makes people more prone to bleeding. Normal platelet counts range from anywhere from 150 000 to 400 000 or so. People can have spontaneous bleeding, including internal bleeding, but that doesn't typically happen unless the platelet levels are less than ten thousand. His levels were reportedly zero, and because they're so low or absent, he gets admitted to the intensive care unit for two weeks. Doctors tried to get his platelet count higher as he had experts from all over the country involved in his care. Presumably, they tried several different treatments. Typically we give platelet transfusions, which is really a blood product that we're transfusing. But also, we give steroids, specifically glucocorticoids, such as salmeterol or methylprednisolone. If that doesn't work, we try other drugs like Ramaplastum or eltrombopag to stimulate the bone marrow to make more platelets. Sometimes we give immunoglobulins, sometimes we give a drug called rituximab, which is a monoclonal antibody. If all else fails, the last resort is to take out the spleen because sometimes a spleen plays a role in sequestering and destroying platelets. So they were actually planning on doing a splenectomy, meaning removing his spleen. Still, shortly before that, he ends up developing a hemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter of minutes. In other words, he bled into his brain. \n\nA sudden get severe thrombocytopenia to the point of bleeding to death because no matter what the cause is, this kind of thing is incredibly rare. I've never had a similar case like this in the intensive care unit. Now there are some cases like this reported with certain drugs medications can lead to thrombocytopenia. As a result of drug-induced antibodies being made by the immune system, they attack the body's platelets. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia refers to acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and it should be suspected when someone has sudden severe thrombocytopenia.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nIG Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/\nFB Page: https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen\n\n#covid #covidvaccine #vaccine", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UijQ-6jhVuc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UijQ-6jhVuc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UijQ-6jhVuc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UijQ-6jhVuc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UijQ-6jhVuc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Doctor Mike Hansen", "tags": ["doctor dies after getting covid 19 vaccine", "vaccine", "pfizer vaccine covid", "covid vaccine", "covid 19 vaccine", "corona vaccine", "covid 19 vaccine deaths", "covid vaccine death", "vaccine deaths", "covid 19 vaccine side effect", "pfizer vaccine", "florida doctor's death", "dr. gregory michael", "vaccine death", "covid 19 vaccine reactions", "doctor dies for covid vaccine", "vaccine for covid 19", "vaccine side effect covid", "covid 19 vaccine death", "covid 19 vaccine side effect video", "covid deaths", "#covid"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Doctor Dies After Getting COVID 19 Vaccine? | Florida Doctor's Death", "description": "Doctor Dies After Getting COVID 19 Vaccine? | Florida Doctor's Death\n\nAn obstetrician/gynecologist (Dr. Gregory Michael) in Miami, Florida, received the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Dec.18th. Shortly after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, he reportedly developed acute immune thrombocytopenia. He died 16 days after getting the covid vaccine. Dr. Gregory Michael's cause of death is a result of a brain hemorrhage. Obviously, this is horrible. It\u2019s tragic, and you feel for his family. \n\nBut it makes you wonder, was his death a result of the covid 19 vaccines? \nAnd if it resulted from the covid 19 vaccine, should that change your perspective on the covid 19 vaccines? \nSo I\u2019m going to tell you my thoughts on this, but first, let's learn a little more about what happened. \nPfizer is actively investigating the case.\n\nOver 10 million people in the United States have received at least one shot of either the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine or Moderna Covid 19 Vaccine, the two authorized in the United States. Me personally, I received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, there have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis, meaning a severe allergic reaction. None of which were reported as fatal. Many people have had other side effects like sore arms, fatigue, headache, or fever, which typically last a day or so.\n\nThe Miami-Dade County medical examiner\u2019s office is investigating Dr. Gregory Michael's death, and as of right now, there is no official autopsy report. But based on the reports, let's see what we can make of his case.\n\nDr. Gregory Michael was healthy. He did not smoke. Did not take any medications. Never had any reaction to any medication nor vaccines. Supposedly three days after he gets the 1st dose of the covid 19 vaccines, he developed tiny reddish spots, or petechiae, caused by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet.\n\nThis prompted him to go to the ER. He gets blood work done, and his platelet levels are low, which is something called thrombocytopenia. Platelets are one of the components of blood clotting. If platelets are too low, it makes people more prone to bleeding. Normal platelet counts range from anywhere from 150 000 to 400 000 or so. People can have spontaneous bleeding, including internal bleeding, but that doesn't typically happen unless the platelet levels are less than ten thousand. His levels were reportedly zero, and because they're so low or absent, he gets admitted to the intensive care unit for two weeks. Doctors tried to get his platelet count higher as he had experts from all over the country involved in his care. Presumably, they tried several different treatments. Typically we give platelet transfusions, which is really a blood product that we're transfusing. But also, we give steroids, specifically glucocorticoids, such as salmeterol or methylprednisolone. If that doesn't work, we try other drugs like Ramaplastum or eltrombopag to stimulate the bone marrow to make more platelets. Sometimes we give immunoglobulins, sometimes we give a drug called rituximab, which is a monoclonal antibody. If all else fails, the last resort is to take out the spleen because sometimes a spleen plays a role in sequestering and destroying platelets. So they were actually planning on doing a splenectomy, meaning removing his spleen. Still, shortly before that, he ends up developing a hemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter of minutes. In other words, he bled into his brain. \n\nA sudden get severe thrombocytopenia to the point of bleeding to death because no matter what the cause is, this kind of thing is incredibly rare. I've never had a similar case like this in the intensive care unit. Now there are some cases like this reported with certain drugs medications can lead to thrombocytopenia. As a result of drug-induced antibodies being made by the immune system, they attack the body's platelets. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia refers to acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and it should be suspected when someone has sudden severe thrombocytopenia.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nIG Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/\nFB Page: https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen\n\n#covid #covidvaccine #vaccine"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT8M21S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "status": {"uploadStatus": "processed", "privacyStatus": "public", "license": "youtube", "embeddable": true, "publicStatsViewable": true, "madeForKids": false}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "4295516", "likeCount": "65982", "dislikeCount": "8976", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "16144"}}], "pageInfo": {"totalResults": 1, "resultsPerPage": 1}}}

Then other vaccines are on the horizon as well that are not mRNA vaccines. 6 vaccines are getting federal government support in the US, and dozens in being developed worldwide. Several of these are in Phase 3 clinical trials, which is the last step before seeking the FDA's go-ahead. The 2 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna synthetically make messenger RNA, a genetic blueprint that signals to the body's cells to start manufacturing a specific protein in the body. Not just any protein but part of the spike protein of the virus. The body\u2019s immune system then says, \u201cHey, we don\u2019t recognize this spike protein guy; we should kick him out of the club. \u201cSo the immune system reacts accordingly. Except when the immune system reacts accordingly, it\u2019s a whole cascade of events, with white blood cells causing a whole bunch of commotion, sending chemical signals to other parts of the body thru the blood, with cytokines, interferons, interleukins\u2026and antibodies are made, which are proteins that bind to pieces of foreign invaders, so that the body is protected the next to go around. This process sometimes causes symptoms to develop, like some arm pain, maybe a little fever, body aches, headache, sometimes nausea, fatigue. And this is what sometimes happens with the flu shot. People sometimes think they got the flu from the flu shot, but that\u2019s never the case. It was the immunological reaction to the vaccination. But back to these mRNA vaccines for COVID. They come in 2 doses, to be taken a few weeks apart. Why? Because the 1st dose, also known as the prime dose, although it does the job, is less than ideal, meaning the level of protective antibodies that develop, they\u2019re there (show hand), but we want them up here (raise hand) to offer better protection. So with the prime dose, the antibodies take 2 weeks to develop. But then we want the second dose, the booster, to get the immune system reactivated. Once that re-activation occurs, immunogenicity is achieved, typically 7-10 days after the booster is given. And when people experience the immune reactions from the mRNA COVID 19 vaccines, it\u2019s not with the 1st dose; it's after the booster. \n\nThe independent board that analyzes the participants in the study found that severe side effects included fatigue (9.7%), muscle pain (8.9%), joint pain (5.2%), and headache (4.5%). Less than 2% had fevers of 39\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C that lasted a day or two. The numbers were lower for the Pfizer vaccine: Severe side effects included fatigue (3.8%) and headache (2%). Now compared to the flu shot, including the high-dose flu shot, these numbers are slightly higher. But otherwise, the trials showed that these vaccines are safe. And they\u2019re very, very effective. In Moderna\u2019s clinical trial, they gave either the vaccine or a placebo to 30,000 people. Of the 15,000 who received the vaccine, 11 developed Covid. Of the 15,000 who received the placebo, 185 developed Covid 19. That\u2019s 94.1% efficacy. None of the 11 people who received the vaccine became severely ill, but 30 of the 185 who received the placebo became severely ill, and one of them died. The vaccine had similar efficacy rates for elderly people and for people in racial minority groups. In Pfizer's clinical trial, the vaccine proved to be 95% effective, and one study participant who received the vaccine developed a severe case of Covid. Both of them give 95% efficacy against symptomatic disease and almost 100% against severe disease.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nIG Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/\nFB Page: https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen\n\n#covid19 #covidvaccine #vaccine", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CwyxGmGXIYM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CwyxGmGXIYM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CwyxGmGXIYM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CwyxGmGXIYM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CwyxGmGXIYM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Doctor Mike Hansen", "tags": ["covid vaccine", "vaccine", "covid 19 vaccine", "vaccine for covid 19", "covid vaccine update", "covid vaccine explained", "pfizer", "coronavirus vaccine update", "astrazeneca", "covid-19 vaccine", "vaccine covid 19", "covid 19 vaccine update", "side effects of covid vaccine", "moderna vaccine", "covid vaccine pfizer", "covid vaccine usa", "astrazeneca covid vaccine", "moderna covid vaccine", "vaccine covid", "vaccine coronavirus", "vaccine pfizer", "coronavirus vaccine pfizer", "covid", "covid 19", "covid 19 vaccine usa"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Covid 19 Vaccine Explained | Covid 19 Vaccine Latest Update Today", "description": "Covid 19 Vaccine Explained | Covid 19 Vaccine Latest Update Today\n*Correction - It Should be Pfizer (not \"Phizer\")\n\n\u23e9 Timestamps, click to skip ahead!\n00:00 Introduction\n1:43 How is it possible a vaccine that, under normal circumstances, would take years to approve could be ready to roll out so quickly and prove to be safe?\n3:30 What are the covid 19 vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer), and how do they work?\n6:03 Safety and Side Effects of covid 19 vaccine\n6:35 How effective are covid 19 vaccines?\n7:31 How long does the covid 19 vaccine protection last?\nDoes it protect against asymptomatic disease?\nDoes it prevent people from spreading the virus to others?\n8:26 Do I still need a vaccine if I had covid 19? \n8:39 Is the vaccine safe for me with my underlying medical condition?\n8:59 Why do the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) require super cold temperatures?\n13:04 Who can get the vaccine?

She also took Birth Control. She worked as a surgical tech for local plastic surgeons. She gets the Moderna Covid 19 vaccine. Her first covid 19 shot goes without incident. Other than a sore arm. Second dose of covid 19 vaccine Moderna - not so much. She gets her 2nd Covid 19 shot on Feb. 1st, which is a Monday. Later that evening, she has a sore arm, nausea, and fever. That\u2019s not unheard of after someone gets the covid 19 vaccine. Some people get a sore arm, fatigue, body aches, slight fever, and chills. Especially after the second covid 19 shot. Especially for younger people. When this happens, people can take Tylenol or ibuprofen. \n_______________________________________\nThis is her GoFundMe page:\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/kassidi-kurill-medical-and-funeral-expenses\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nNo big deal, right? Unless they take too much.  \nShe did take Tylenol, aka Acetaminophen, but we don\u2019t know how much. She felt a little better the next day. By Wednesday, she was not able to pee despite drinking lots of fluids. She says it's the worst she ever felt. Thursday, 6 am, she tells her parents she needs to go to the hospital. In the ER, she immediately starts throwing up. Doctors say, \u201cshe was very, very sick, and her liver was not functioning.\" Blood tests show that her liver is not working. The doctors give her IV fluids. They also give her a drug to counteract the effects of Tylenol on the liver. It's called NAC, or n-acetylcysteine. But the damage was already done. Around this time, she becomes incoherent. This is because acute liver failure causes the brain to swell, called cerebral edema. If severe enough, it can result in a coma. At this point, her only chance of survival is with a liver transplant. \n\nSo she was flown to a transplant hospital. But when the liver completely fails, it causes other organs to follow suit. Especially the kidneys and brain, and soon after heart and lungs. She\u2019s put on full life support, including a breathing tube. Even if there was a match for a new liver, she is too unstable to undergo that operation. She dies. About 30 hours after she first arrived at the ER. She leaves behind a young daughter who wants people to hear her story. \n\nA lot of people will conclude that the covid 19 vaccine caused her death. \nBut timing by itself does not prove causation. \nAnd a lot of people want to know, did the covid 19 vaccine cause her death? \nAnd if not, then what? \nA Utah medical examiner completed a full autopsy...but the results remain private. The Medical Examiner said the autopsy did not show a link between the covid 19 vaccine and death. \n\nWhich is hardly surprising. If a covid 19 vaccine caused someone to die shortly after receiving it, how would it do so? The only medical explanation would be an immunological reaction. Meaning an allergic reaction. So far in the US, there have been over 200 million covid 19 vaccine doses given. No one has died from a severe allergic reaction as a result of the COVID 19 vaccine. \n\nAnd in her case, it's obvious that she did not have an allergic reaction. For example, there was no swelling in the face or tongue or tightening of the throat. Deaths after COVID 19 vaccinations are reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.\n\nBetween Dec. 14 and mid-March, there have been over 109 million covid 19 vaccine doses in the US. \nOf those, there have been less than 2,000 reports of death on the VAERS system, which is 0.0018%. A reported death in the VAERS system doesn\u2019t mean the covid 19 vaccine caused it.\n\nSo the big question in Kassidi Kurill\u2019s case is\u2026what caused her acute liver failure?\nIn the US, acetaminophen accounts for 40% of cases. \nIn 18% of cases, there is no identifiable cause. 13% are due to idiosyncratic drug reactions. \nThe general recommended dose for acetaminophen in healthy people is no more than 4 grams per day. Sometimes people end up taking more than they should. This accounts for almost half of the cases of acetaminophen-induced-acute liver failure.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nIG Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/\nFB Page: https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen\n\n#covidvaccine #vaccine #covid19vaccine", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wosyaWiDR2U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wosyaWiDR2U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wosyaWiDR2U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wosyaWiDR2U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wosyaWiDR2U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Doctor Mike Hansen", "tags": ["post vaccine deaths", "covid 19 vaccine", "moderna covid 19 vaccine", "covid 19 shot", "second dose of covid 19", "second dose", "dose of covid 19", "covid 19 vaccine reactions", "vaccine side effect", "covid 19 vaccine side effect", "covid vaccine side effect", "covid 19 vaccine shot", "second dose of covid 19 vaccine", "second dose of covid 19 vaccine reaction", "2nd dose of covid 19", "second covid shot effects", "dies after getting moderna vaccine", "covid 19 shots", "covid vaccine", "covid vaccine death"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Woman Dies 4 days after getting COVID 19 Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths", "description": "Woman Dies 4 days after getting COVID 19 Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths\n\nKassidi Kurill, a 39-year-old Single Mom. Her family describes her as healthy, happy, and \u201chaving more energy\u201d than most. She had no known health problems. Unless you count Trigeminal Neuralgia. She took Botox for that. She also took Birth Control. She worked as a surgical tech for local plastic surgeons. She gets the Moderna Covid 19 vaccine. Her first covid 19 shot goes without incident. Other than a sore arm. Second dose of covid 19 vaccine Moderna - not so much. She gets her 2nd Covid 19 shot on Feb. 1st, which is a Monday. Later that evening, she has a sore arm, nausea, and fever. That\u2019s not unheard of after someone gets the covid 19 vaccine. Some people get a sore arm, fatigue, body aches, slight fever, and chills. Especially after the second covid 19 shot. Especially for younger people. When this happens, people can take Tylenol or ibuprofen. \n_______________________________________\nThis is her GoFundMe page:\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/kassidi-kurill-medical-and-funeral-expenses\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nNo big deal, right? Unless they take too much.  \nShe did take Tylenol, aka Acetaminophen, but we don\u2019t know how much. She felt a little better the next day. By Wednesday, she was not able to pee despite drinking lots of fluids. She says it's the worst she ever felt. Thursday, 6 am, she tells her parents she needs to go to the hospital. In the ER, she immediately starts throwing up. Doctors say, \u201cshe was very, very sick, and her liver was not functioning.\" Blood tests show that her liver is not working. The doctors give her IV fluids. They also give her a drug to counteract the effects of Tylenol on the liver. It's called NAC, or n-acetylcysteine. But the damage was already done. Around this time, she becomes incoherent. This is because acute liver failure causes the brain to swell, called cerebral edema. If severe enough, it can result in a coma. At this point, her only chance of survival is with a liver transplant. \n\nSo she was flown to a transplant hospital. But when the liver completely fails, it causes other organs to follow suit. Especially the kidneys and brain, and soon after heart and lungs. She\u2019s put on full life support, including a breathing tube. Even if there was a match for a new liver, she is too unstable to undergo that operation. She dies. About 30 hours after she first arrived at the ER. She leaves behind a young daughter who wants people to hear her story. \n\nA lot of people will conclude that the covid 19 vaccine caused her death. \nBut timing by itself does not prove causation. \nAnd a lot of people want to know, did the covid 19 vaccine cause her death? \nAnd if not, then what? \nA Utah medical examiner completed a full autopsy...but the results remain private. The Medical Examiner said the autopsy did not show a link between the covid 19 vaccine and death. \n\nWhich is hardly surprising. If a covid 19 vaccine caused someone to die shortly after receiving it, how would it do so? The only medical explanation would be an immunological reaction. Meaning an allergic reaction. So far in the US, there have been over 200 million covid 19 vaccine doses given. No one has died from a severe allergic reaction as a result of the COVID 19 vaccine. \n\nAnd in her case, it's obvious that she did not have an allergic reaction. For example, there was no swelling in the face or tongue or tightening of the throat. Deaths after COVID 19 vaccinations are reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.\n\nBetween Dec. 14 and mid-March, there have been over 109 million covid 19 vaccine doses in the US. \nOf those, there have been less than 2,000 reports of death on the VAERS system, which is 0.0018%. A reported death in the VAERS system doesn\u2019t mean the covid 19 vaccine caused it.\n\nSo the big question in Kassidi Kurill\u2019s case is\u2026what caused her acute liver failure?\nIn the US, acetaminophen accounts for 40% of cases. \nIn 18% of cases, there is no identifiable cause. 13% are due to idiosyncratic drug reactions. \nThe general recommended dose for acetaminophen in healthy people is no more than 4 grams per day.

Many studies illustrate both types of vaccine failure as well as the concerning potential for vaccinated individuals to transmit disease to others. In a 2017 measles outbreak in vaccinated individuals in Israel\u2014reported on by the CDC\u2014all but one patient had laboratory evidence of a \u201cprevious immune response\u201d (secondary vaccine failure), and the one patient who did not display such evidence reported nonetheless having received two doses of vaccine (primary vaccine failure). In addition, the index patient\u2014the one who launched the chain of transmission\u2014had received three doses of measles-containing vaccine. In a 2011 measles outbreak in New York City, \u201call cases had prior evidence of measles immunity,\u201d and a twice-vaccinated individual\u2014whose \u201cclinical presentation\u201d was just like natural measles\u2014was shown to have transmitted measles to others. Currently there have been over 9000 cases of mumps but that isn't getting media scrutiny. In MMR-related lawsuits against Merck, former Merck scientists avow that Merck \u201cfraudulently misled the government and omitted, concealed, and adulterated material information regarding the efficacy of its mumps vaccine in violation of the FCA [False Claims Act].\u201d According to a report by Huffpost, the company\u2019s \u201cfar-ranging\u201d fraudulent activities were designed to help Merck monopolize the mumps vaccine market, even though Merck \u201cexpected outbreaks to occur\u201d as a result of its shoddy vaccine. Lastly, The MMR vaccine contains aborted fetal cells. This is strictly against the religion of many. America was founded upon religious independence.

Many studies illustrate both types of vaccine failure as well as the concerning potential for vaccinated individuals to transmit disease to others. In a 2017 measles outbreak in vaccinated individuals in Israel\u2014reported on by the CDC\u2014all but one patient had laboratory evidence of a \u201cprevious immune response\u201d (secondary vaccine failure), and the one patient who did not display such evidence reported nonetheless having received two doses of vaccine (primary vaccine failure). In addition, the index patient\u2014the one who launched the chain of transmission\u2014had received three doses of measles-containing vaccine. In a 2011 measles outbreak in New York City, \u201call cases had prior evidence of measles immunity,\u201d and a twice-vaccinated individual\u2014whose \u201cclinical presentation\u201d was just like natural measles\u2014was shown to have transmitted measles to others. Currently there have been over 9000 cases of mumps but that isn't getting media scrutiny. In MMR-related lawsuits against Merck, former Merck scientists avow that Merck \u201cfraudulently misled the government and omitted, concealed, and adulterated material information regarding the efficacy of its mumps vaccine in violation of the FCA [False Claims Act].\u201d According to a report by Huffpost, the company\u2019s \u201cfar-ranging\u201d fraudulent activities were designed to help Merck monopolize the mumps vaccine market, even though Merck \u201cexpected outbreaks to occur\u201d as a result of its shoddy vaccine. Lastly, The MMR vaccine contains aborted fetal cells. This is strictly against the religion of many. America was founded upon religious independence. The state should not Force vaccinate anyone against their will and religion.

In this episode, we discuss the COVID-19 vaccines, and what questions you would want to answer in order to understand them: Are they safe? Are they effective? If you survive COVID-19, what are the long-term health effects? We discuss what an mRNA vaccine is and does, and how the immune system functions (and fails to function). We also talk about what makes flies sexy.

If you survive COVID-19, what are the long-term health effects? We discuss what an mRNA vaccine is and does, and how the immune system functions (and fails to function). We also talk about what makes flies sexy.

The Lord said me to tell the church as He taught me saying - There are many preparations, initiations, and harvests of the kingdom of heaven and of darkness going on the earth. There are so much preparation done by the kingdom of darkness, and there's no one to stop them because there are scarcity of faithful Reapers. The Lord said - I gave this quotation (Lk 14:16-24) because it's popularly used and many have taught through them but they lack understanding in the spirit of wisdom and revelation. They fail to realize that it's the spirit of prophecy till the fulfilment of Christ's coming be fulfilled. The Lord said - the kingdoms of darkness live and monitor the times and seasons of times, but the children of light fail to realize that this word of the Lord is the Spirit of Prophecy.\n\nThen, the Lord said - in this scripture there are three categories of people that were, are and will be from the foundation of the world until the coming of Christ Jesus. For in these categories He has extended His salvation. He said - the first category are those that gave excuses of ground, of oxen, and wife. They truly serve the Lord and fear Him; they're those that walk in His ways and can't even stand those that err around them. They're have become the role models to others, for many look up to them. They've grown so much in the Lord for years, but these are their offenses; they are careless to what is around them. What they couldn't afford to commit against God before is what they craftily commit without remorse. And because they still have the grace of God in them, they believe it'll save them. They can't be taught anymore, neither receive the words of God from others. The Lord said - the reason why I said they'll never taste from my supper is because - they shall be bound in their carelessness and will not be able to discover their shame, and they shall not seek correction but continue until it shall be too late for them.\n\nThen, the Lord said - the second category are those from the streets, the poor, the maimed, the halt and the blind. He said - they are called The Blind Faithfuls. They are those that like double lives. They live for God with a true heart but live for the devil. They fear the Lord knowing His power and glory but never His salvation. They are good givers and never joke with the things of God, However, when they're not in the presence of God, everything that's of the world, they embrace it. Everything and anything of luxury and wealth, they yearn for it. But they are not pretenders. People know them for who they are and what they are. The Lord has extended His hand of salvation, but their time has passed.\n\nAccording to the Spirit of Prophecy of the quotation given to the church by the Lord, we are now in the last and final category. These are the ones from the highways and hedges. The Lord said - I have sent my angels to rescue them and deliver them, for they are those that are lost and hopeless. They are those that don't have any chance or strength to lift up their heads to heaven and say Abba Father. Now, the Lord said - I go a fishing for souls, will you go with me? This is the mystery of the Reapers. The Lord is searching for the Reapers of Grace and Truth. He said to me - The reapers must be worthy and better in holiness and righteousness than all the three categories. They are the ones I gave the ministry to reap where they didn't sow; this ministry wasn't given to the angels. The reapers must be perfect; if they're not, the freed captives will return back to bondage. They are The reapers to Evangelise, the reapers of Intercession, and the reapers In the Shepherds' Office. I seek reapers to reap the harvests of my angels I've sent forth to deliver the captives They aremy last harvest, and then the end shall come.\n\nYouTube - RAPEC Tv\nWebsite - www.raptureproclaimer.org\n\nGod bless you", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdUyJF0X_kc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdUyJF0X_kc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdUyJF0X_kc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdUyJF0X_kc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdUyJF0X_kc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "The Messiahs Return", "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "URGENT RAPTURE MESSAGE - RESTITUTION - THE RETURN OF JESUS CHRIST", "description": "*RAPTURE PROCLAIMER EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF GOD*\nTopic: *WHO SHALL REAP MY HARVEST?*\n*Text: Lk. 14:16-24.*\n*Date: 26th April 2020*\n\nThe message of the Lord came to me at about 3am 25th April 2020 to the church saying WHO SHALL REAP MY HARVEST?

Specifically, does a positive PCR-test result mean that the person tested is infected with Covid-19, or does it mean absolutely nothing in connection with the Covid-19 infection?\n\n2) Do the so-called anti-corona measures, such as the lockdown, mandatory face masks, social distancing, and quarantine regulations, serve to protect the world\u2019s population from corona? Or do these measures serve only to make people panic so that they believe, without asking any questions, that their lives are in danger \u2014 so that, in the end, the pharmaceutical and tech industries can generate huge profits from the sale of PCR tests, antigen and antibody tests and vaccines, as well as the harvesting of our genetic fingerprints?\n\n3) Is it true that the German government was massively lobbied, more so than any other country, by the chief protagonists of this so-called corona pandemic (Mr. Drosten, virologist at Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin; Mr. Wieler, veterinarian and head of the German equivalent of the CDC, the RKI; and Mr. Tedros, head of the World Health Organization or WHO) because Germany is known as a particularly disciplined country and was therefore to become a role model for the rest of the world for its strict and, of course, successful adherence to the corona measures?\n\nAll evidence will be available to lawyers around the world to pursue their own class action lawsuits. \n\nDr. Fuellmich also explains that the \u201coverwhelming majority of the alleged Covid-19 victims had died of completely different diseases, but not of Covid-19. The assertion that the lockdown was necessary because there were so many different infections with SARS-CoV-2, and because the healthcare systems would be overwhelmed is wrong for three reasons, as we have learned from the hearings we conducted with the Corona Committee, and from other data that has become available in the meantime:\n\n1) The lockdown was imposed when the virus was already retreating. By the time the lockdown was imposed, the alleged infection rates were already dropping again.\n\n2) There\u2019s already protection from the virus because of cross- or T-cell immunity. Apart from the above mentioned lockdown being imposed when the infection rates were already dropping, there is also cross- or T-cell immunity in the general population against the corona viruses contained in every flu or influenza wave.\n\n3) And this is the most important part of our fact-finding.

Specifically, does a positive PCR-test result mean that the person tested is infected with Covid-19, or does it mean absolutely nothing in connection with the Covid-19 infection?\n\n2) Do the so-called anti-corona measures, such as the lockdown, mandatory face masks, social distancing, and quarantine regulations, serve to protect the world\u2019s population from corona? Or do these measures serve only to make people panic so that they believe, without asking any questions, that their lives are in danger \u2014 so that, in the end, the pharmaceutical and tech industries can generate huge profits from the sale of PCR tests, antigen and antibody tests and vaccines, as well as the harvesting of our genetic fingerprints?\n\n3) Is it true that the German government was massively lobbied, more so than any other country, by the chief protagonists of this so-called corona pandemic (Mr. Drosten, virologist at Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin; Mr. Wieler, veterinarian and head of the German equivalent of the CDC, the RKI; and Mr. Tedros, head of the World Health Organization or WHO) because Germany is known as a particularly disciplined country and was therefore to become a role model for the rest of the world for its strict and, of course, successful adherence to the corona measures?\n\nAll evidence will be available to lawyers around the world to pursue their own class action lawsuits. \n\nDr. Fuellmich also explains that the \u201coverwhelming majority of the alleged Covid-19 victims had died of completely different diseases, but not of Covid-19. The assertion that the lockdown was necessary because there were so many different infections with SARS-CoV-2, and because the healthcare systems would be overwhelmed is wrong for three reasons, as we have learned from the hearings we conducted with the Corona Committee, and from other data that has become available in the meantime:\n\n1) The lockdown was imposed when the virus was already retreating. By the time the lockdown was imposed, the alleged infection rates were already dropping again.\n\n2) There\u2019s already protection from the virus because of cross- or T-cell immunity. Apart from the above mentioned lockdown being imposed when the infection rates were already dropping, there is also cross- or T-cell immunity in the general population against the corona viruses contained in every flu or influenza wave.\n\n3) And this is the most important part of our fact-finding. The PCR test is being used on the basis of false statements, not based on scientific facts with respect to infections. In the meantime, we have learned that these PCR tests, contrary to the assertions of Messrs. Drosten, Wieler and the WHO, do not give any indication of an infection with any virus let alone an infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nVIDEO: https://youtu.be/kr04gHbP5MQ \n\nTRANSCRIPT: https://truthcomestolight.com/2020/10/08/transcript-of-dr-reiner-fuellmichs-crimes-against-humanity-announcing-the-largest-international-class-action-tort-case-in-world-history/ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlease like and subscribe to our Bright Light News youtube channel for more info that sheds a light on the science and data of Covid-19.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @_BLNews_\n\nLike/follow us on Facebook at Bright Light News."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-CA"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT49M1S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "status": {"uploadStatus": "processed", "privacyStatus": "public", "license": "youtube", "embeddable": true, "publicStatsViewable": true, "madeForKids": false}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1351", "likeCount": "69", "dislikeCount": "2", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "7"}}], "pageInfo": {"totalResults": 1, "resultsPerPage": 1}}}

LeBoutillier said that after the war, a deal was cut to pay billions to North Vietnam for rebuilding their country and returning the remaining POWs. But as the Watergate scandal broke, Nixon and Kissinger reneged on the arrangement, and around 700 prisoners were kept in Vietnam. Others have worked for 20 years in Washington DC to uncover the truth about the POWs, and there has been much intelligence that has referenced the missing soldiers. Specifically, spy satellite photographs, one of which (see below) showed \"USA\" spelled out in 12 ft. tall letters in a rice field, along with a 24 ft. tall \"Walking K\" an \"escape and evasion\" code only known to US pilots in N. Laos. In the early 80's, Reagan tried to get the POWs back, but advisors talked him out of it. By 1992, an investigation chaired by McCain and Kerry concluded there were no American refugees left in Vietnam. It is believed there could be as many as 500-600 POWs still alive there, and that the US government is engaged in a cover-up of the evidence for their existence. \nA terrible truth is now emerging: Recently declassified documents show that American prisoners are to this day still crying out for help in Vietnam. \n\nNorth Carolina congressman Bill Hendon and attorney Elizabeth A. Stewart- An Enormous Crime: The Definitive Account of American POW's Abandoned in Southeast Asia - presents evidence that 700 surviving U.S. airmen and infantry were marooned by the country for which they went to war, and to this day remain unacknowledged by that same country, the United States of America. In spite of decades during which these POWs have bravely signaled for help, and in which numerous refugees and visitors from Indochina have in turn corroborated their pleas, their heartrending tale has been dismissed as nothing more than conspiracy theory and rumor. Shockingly, the proof laid out in An Enormous Crime proves otherwise, such as the 1991 satellite images of two Americans in North Vietnam who had stamped out their pilot authenticator codes in the grass in the compound where they were being held. Another satellite photograph showed \"USA\" spelled out in 12-foot-tall letters in a rice field, along with a 24-foot-tall \"Walking K\" - an escape and evasion code only known to U.S. pilots in North Laos.\n\nTo begin to understand this travesty, it's important to go back to the beginning: In 1972, negotiations began with the Vietnamese to settle scores. At issue was the return of American POWs. During late 1972 and early 1973, a deal was struck whereby half of the 1,400 US POWs held by North Vietnam would be released once military withdrawal began. The initial 700 or so American soldiers held captive were flown out of Hanoi during Operation Homecoming later in 1973. It was agreed upon by the Nixon administration and the North Vietnamese that the other 700 POWs would be released upon delivery of $4 billion in war reparations from the United States to the North Vietnamese government. \n\nBut as the Watergate scandal broke, Nixon reneged on the arrangement, and the last 700 POWs were kept in Vietnam. All future presidents after Nixon had their own reasons for failing to take notice off the 700 POWs left behind: For Carter it was the American public's desire to put Vietnam behind them, and later, the Iranian hostage crisis. In the early 80's, Reagan tried to get the POWs back, but his advisors talked him out of it. The problem, the advisors told him, was that the fragile U.S.-backed El Salvadoran government was under serious threat of being overthrown by Russian and Cuban trained Communists, and Nicaragua didn't look far behind. The advisors told Regan that it was necessary to overlook the POWs in order to put all American military efforts toward the darkening South American situation.\n\nAs the 80's gave way to the 90's, re-engagement of Vietnam by the U.S. government became a priority. Thus George H.W. Bush helped maintain the cover up of mounting evidence that hundreds of POWs still survived in Indochina, as did Bill Clinton, who himself struck down all sanctions and embargoes against Vietnam in 1992. But even in that same year, satellite photos over Vietnam revealed airman-specific 4-digit authenticator codes proving almost conclusively that as of 1992, U.S. airmen downed in Vietnam during the war remained alive and were signaling for help.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3UJEmu3V5k/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3UJEmu3V5k/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3UJEmu3V5k/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3UJEmu3V5k/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Veritas TV", "tags": ["mel fabregas", "veritasradio.com", "veritas radio", "veritas show", "veritasshow.com", "george hw bush", "brent scowcroft", "henry kissinger", "vietnam pows", "an enourmous crime", "john leboutillier", "bill hendon", "elizabeth stewart", "john mccain"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "John LeBoutillier U.S. Cover-Up of POW/MIA Abandoned in Southeast Asia (John McCain)", "description": "This is Segment 1 of 2.
